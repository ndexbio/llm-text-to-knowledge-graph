      "text": "There are substantial shortcomings in the drugs currently available for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The global diabetic crisis has not abated despite the introduction of new types of drugs and targets. Persistent unaddressed patient needs remain a significant factor in the quest for new leads in routine studies. Drug discovery methods in this area have followed developments in the market, contributing to a recent rise in the number of molecules. Nevertheless, troubling developments and fresh challenges are still evident. Recently, metformin, the most widely used first-line drug for diabetes, was found to contain a carcinogenic contaminant known as N-nitroso dimethylamine (NDMA). Therefore, purity and toxicity are also a big challenge for drug discovery and development. Moreover, newer drug classes against SGLT-2 illustrate both progress and difficulties. The same was true previously in the case of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Furthermore, researchers must study the importance of mechanistic characteristics of novel compounds, as well as exposure-related hazardous aspects of current and newly identified protein targets, in order to identify new pharmacological molecules with improved selectivity and specificity.",

      "text": "The heat stress response activates the transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), which subsequently upregulates heat shock proteins to maintain the integrity of the proteome. HSF1 activation requires nuclear localization, trimerization, DNA binding, phosphorylation and gene transactivation. Phosphorylation at S326 is an important regulator of HSF1 transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation at S326 is mediated by AKT1, mTOR, p38, MEK1 and DYRK2. Here, we observed activation of HSF1 by AKT1 independently of mTOR. AKT2 also phosphorylated S326 of HSF1 but showed weak ability to activate HSF1. Similarly, mTOR, p38, MEK1 and DYRK2 all phosphorylated S326 but AKT1 was the most potent activator. Mass spectrometry showed that AKT1 also phosphorylated HSF1 at T142, S230 and T527 in addition to S326, whereas the other kinases did not. Subsequent investigation revealed that phosphorylation at T142 is necessary for HSF1 trimerization and that S230, S326 and T527 are required for HSF1 gene transactivation and recruitment of TFIIB and CDK9. Interestingly, T527 as a phosphorylated residue has not been previously shown and sits in the transactivation domain, further implying a role for this site in HSF1 gene transactivation. This study suggests that HSF1 hyperphosphorylation is targeted and these specific residues have direct function in regulating HSF1 transcriptional activity.",

      "text": "The heat stress response activates the transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), which subsequently upregulates heat shock proteins to maintain the integrity of the proteome. HSF1 activation requires nuclear localization, trimerization, DNA binding, phosphorylation and gene transactivation. Phosphorylation at S326 is an important regulator of HSF1 transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation at S326 is mediated by AKT1, mTOR, p38, MEK1 and DYRK2. Here, we observed activation of HSF1 by AKT1 independently of mTOR. AKT2 also phosphorylated S326 of HSF1 but showed weak ability to activate HSF1. Similarly, mTOR, p38, MEK1 and DYRK2 all phosphorylated S326 but AKT1 was the most potent activator. Mass spectrometry showed that AKT1 also phosphorylated HSF1 at T142, S230 and T527 in addition to S326, whereas the other kinases did not. Subsequent investigation revealed that phosphorylation at T142 is necessary for HSF1 trimerization and that S230, S326 and T527 are required for HSF1 gene transactivation and recruitment of TFIIB and CDK9. Interestingly, T527 as a phosphorylated residue has not been previously shown and sits in the transactivation domain, further implying a role for this site in HSF1 gene transactivation. This study suggests that HSF1 hyperphosphorylation is targeted and these specific residues have direct function in regulating HSF1 transcriptional activity.",

AKT2 and AKT3 promoted on minimal amounts of HSF1 trimerization (Fig. 2A-B). Similarly, introduction of AKT1 promoted a significant increase of HSF1 binding to putative targets HSPA1A (HSP70), HSPA8 (HSP73) and HSPD1 (HSP60), whereas AKT2 and AKT3 had no significant effect on HSF1 binding (Fig. 2C). To confirm whether DNA binding of HSF1 resulted in gene transactivation, we further assessed expression of HSP70 and HSP90, well-known HSF1 target genes, in response to expression of AKT1, AKT2 or AKT3. Both HSP70 and HSP70 expression were seen to increase more in response to AKT1 than other isoforms (Fig. 2D-E). We did not observe any effect of AKT1 on HSF1 protein half-life (Fig. S1). These results indicate that AKT1 is the primary AKT isoform capable of activating HSF1 with AKT2 having modest effects in cells.",
