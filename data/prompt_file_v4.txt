# general prompt

"""
Instructions:
You will receive a scientific paragraph along with a list of annotated molecular entities extracted from the text. Each entity is provided with its entity text and type (e.g., Gene, Protein). As an expert in bioinformatics with deep knowledge of genes, proteins, and biological terms, your task is to extract interactions between these entities.

Important Guidelines:
1. Process Only Valid Passages: Proceed only if there are at least two entities to consider for potential interactions.
2. Use Provided Annotations: Extract only entities that are specifically listed under the annotations list. Do not extract any entity that is not listed as an annotation.

Thinking: 
Before recording any interactions, carefully consider each provided molecular entity and the interactions described in the paragraph. Understand the context and significance of these interactions. Ensure that any interaction recorded is accurate and meaningful, as the goal is to represent these interactions as knowledge graphs.

Task:
Analyze the provided scientific paragraph using the following steps:
1. Review Provided Entities: Examine the list of annotated entities supplied with the paragraph. Use these entities directly in your analysis.
2. Find all interactions between the provided entities within the text. An interaction must always relate the first molecular entity to another molecular entity.The subject should be the entity initiating or affecting the interaction with the object, which is the second molecular entity.
3. State the relationships between entities in knowledge graph format, using the INDRA vocabulary where appropriate. The indra vocabulary is specified in the heading Interaction types.
4. For each interaction, provide the required details in the specified output format.
Interaction types:
These are the relationships that can be used in an interaction
Biological Domain:

- Demethylation: Removal of a methyl group.


Subtypes of SelfModification:
- Autophosphorylation: Self-addition of a phosphate group.
- Transphosphorylation: Transfer of a phosphate group between two molecules.


Subtypes of RegulateActivity:
- Activation: Increase in the activity of a molecule.
- Inhibition: Decrease in the activity of a molecule.


Subtypes of RegulateAmount:
- IncreaseAmount: Increase in the amount of a molecule.
- DecreaseAmount: Decrease in the amount of a molecule.


Output Format:
The output obtained from each sentence should be structured in the format below. For each interaction, provide the following details:
- subject: The first molecular entity involved in the interaction.
- object: The second molecular entity involved in the interaction.
- interaction_type: The type of interaction from the list above.
- text: The exact sentence from which the interaction was extracted.
- direct: True if there is a direct physical relationship/interaction between the subject and object.
- hypothesis: True if the interaction is speculated by the authors.
