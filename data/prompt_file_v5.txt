# general prompt

Instructions:
You will receive a scientific text with sentences detailing biological interactions between molecular entities. Extract interactions strictly based on the information given in each sentence. Do not reuse entities or interactions from previous examples unless they are explicitly mentioned in the current sentence. As an expert in bioinformatics with deep knowledge of genes, proteins, the Biological Expression Language, and biological terms, identify and resolve each molecular entity to standard identifiers (e.g., HGNC gene symbols, GO terms). Record interactions between pairs of entities, skipping sentences without interactions, and represent the interactions in the BEL (Biological Expression Language) format. Don't repeat the examples that are provided, they are just giving to you as guidance.

Important Guidelines:
1. Only Extract BEL Statements: Your task is to return the correct BEL statement based solely on the provided sentence that is passed to you.
2. Use Only Entities Mentioned in the Sentence: Ensure the BEL statement uses biological entities and processes explicitly mentioned in the sentence. Do not infer interactions involving entities not present in the sentence.
3. Sentence Grounding: Ensure that each BEL statement is directly grounded in the provided sentence. If there is any ambiguity or lack of clarity in the sentence, do not make assumptions or infer relationships beyond what is explicitly stated.
4. Skip Non-Interaction Sentences: If the sentence does not describe an interaction between molecular entities, do not generate a BEL statement for that sentence.

Task:
1. Process the Sentences: For each sentence provided, extract relevant interactions and convert them into BEL format, ensuring that the extracted entities and interactions align with the sentence's content.
2. Use BEL Format: Use the BEL relationships and vocabulary provided below.

Interaction types:
These are the relationships that can be used in an interaction (using BEL vocabulary).

BEL Biological Functions:
- abundance: Chemical or drug abundance
- activity: Denotes activity of protein, RNA, complex
- biologicalProcess: Biological processes
- cellSecretion: Denote secretion of abundance from the cell
- cellSurfaceExpression: Expresses an abundance moved to the cellular surface
- complexAbundance: Complex of biological/chemical abundances
- compositeAbundance: Not a complex but a set of abundances that together produce an effect
- degradation: Denotes degradation of an abundance
- fragment: Modifier function for protein fragments
- fusion: Modifier function for biomolecule fusions
- geneAbundance: Gene abundance
- location: Modifier function for abundance location
- microRNAAbundance: MicroRNA abundance
- molecularActivity: Modifier function – specifies specific type of activity
- pathology: Pathologies - disease or pathological process
- proteinAbundance: Protein abundance
- proteinModification: Modifier function for protein modifications
- reaction: Reaction function - reactants and products
- rnaAbundance: RNA abundance
- translocation: Denotes movement of abundance from one location to another
- variant: Modifier function for gene/RNA/protein variants

- isA
A is a subset of B
- negativeCorrelation, neg
A is negatively correlated with B
- orthologous
A is orthologous to B
- positiveCorrelation, pos
A is positively correlated with B
- rateLimitingStepOf
A is a rate limiting step of B
- regulates, reg
A regulates (effects) B somehow
- subProcessOf
A is a subprocess of B
- transcribedTo, :>
gene is transcribed to RNA
- translatedTo, >>
RNA is translated to protein

Output Format:
For each sentence provided, extract the relevant interactions and return them directly in BEL format. Do not include any other metadata or explanations, only the BEL interaction statements.

Example Formats: These examples are just to guide you for the kind of output I should get. Do not repeat the examples in the interactions except if it is the same sentence explicitly. These are just guiding examples, don't repeat them.

3. "text": "TF works at the surface of cell membranes, and its activity is highly dependent on the presence of phosphatidylserine (PS), an anionic phospholipid that is redistributed on the cell surface during apoptotic death and confers a potent pro-coagulant activity to the apoptotic cell .",

4. "text": "The proto-oncogene c-myc can promote cell death (probably mediated through p53) or cell proliferation, depending on its expression level. It functions as a nuclear phosphoprotein with particular properties of a transcription factor . In serum deprived cultures, cells overexpressing c-myc readily undergo apoptosis. In addition, deregulation of c-myc causes apoptosis of VSMCs deprived of growth factors or treated with cytokines such as interferon-g .",
