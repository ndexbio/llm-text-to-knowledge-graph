These diabetes-associated haplotypes caused a decrease in SLC16A11 expression in the liver and disrupted interaction with basigin, which reduced the cell surface localization of SLC16A11. SLC16A11 knockdown in primary human hepatocytes leads to modulation of fatty acid and lipid metabolism. This modulation increases intracellular acylcarnitine, diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol levels which results in increased triglycerides in blood circulation and an accumulation in liver tissue. The increased levels of triglycerides are implicated in insulin resistance, so variants of SLC16A11 may increase the risk of diabetes by regulating lipid metabolism.

The first reference to diabetes was in 1550 B.C. in an Egyptian papyrus, where it was described as a rare disease characterized by excessive weight loss and frequent urination. The term diabetes (to siphon or to pass through, in Greek) was first used by Apollonius of Memphis, who noted that patients with diabetes present with frequent urination. A Greek physician, Galen, hypothesized it to be a type of kidney disease, as the most prominent symptom was glucosuria. Avicenna (980-1037) offered a comprehensive description of diabetes mellitus in his publication \"The Canon of Medicine\" in 1025. Eventually, owing to its characteristic symptoms, many tests to more fully identify the disease were developed in the late 11th century, involving the examination of the subject's urine's color, odor and taste. The sweet taste of a diabetic patient's urine apparently led to its second name, mellitus (honey, in Latin). Later in the 19th century, Matthew Dobson discovered that the excessive amount of sugar in the urine of patients with diabetes gives it that sweet taste. He also provided an important distinction between the two different types of diabetes, which are now referred to as type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Banting and Macleod observed a reduction in blood glucose levels after administering islets of Langerhans to a pancreatectomized dog, and for this breakthrough discovery they were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1923. Eli Lilly acquired the first deal to produce insulin on a commercial level. Gradually, by the late 20th century, as the mechanisms behind diabetes started to unfold, various insulin preparations and other oral hypoglycemic drugs paved their way onto the market.","interaction":"decreases","bel_expression":"a(CHEBI:insulin) decreases a(CHEBI:\"blood glucose\")"}},{"id":3,"s":3,"t":5,"v":{"evidence":"DM is a major threat to both the developed and developing worlds.
