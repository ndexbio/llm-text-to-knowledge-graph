# general prompt

Instructions:
You will receive a scientific text containing sentences about biological interactions between molecular entities. Extract interactions **only based on the information in the sentence**. Do not use examples from other sentences, and do not infer interactions beyond what is explicitly mentioned.

Key Rules:
1. Only return BEL statements based on the provided sentence.
2. Use only the entities and processes mentioned in the sentence.
3. If a sentence does not describe an interaction, return no BEL statement.
4. Do not reuse or infer information from other sentences.

BEL Format:
Represent the interactions using the following BEL functions and relationships:

BEL Biological Functions:
- abundance: Chemical or drug abundance
- activity: Denotes activity of protein, RNA, complex
- biologicalProcess: Biological processes
- cellSecretion: Denote secretion of abundance from the cell
- cellSurfaceExpression: Expresses an abundance moved to the cellular surface
- complexAbundance: Complex of biological/chemical abundances
- compositeAbundance: Not a complex but a set of abundances that together produce an effect
- degradation: Denotes degradation of an abundance
- fragment: Modifier function for protein fragments
- fusion: Modifier function for biomolecule fusions
- geneAbundance: Gene abundance
- location: Modifier function for abundance location
- microRNAAbundance: MicroRNA abundance
- molecularActivity: Modifier function – specifies specific type of activity
- pathology: Pathologies - disease or pathological process
- proteinAbundance: Protein abundance
- proteinModification: Modifier function for protein modifications
- reaction: Reaction function - reactants and products
- rnaAbundance: RNA abundance
- translocation: Denotes movement of abundance from one location to another
- variant: Modifier function for gene/RNA/protein variants

BEL Relations:
association, –
- A is associated with B - least informative relationship
- causesNoChange, cnc: A causes no change in B
- decreases, -|
  A indirectly decreases B
- directlyDecreases, =|
 A directly decreases B
- directlyIncreases, =>
  A directly increases B
- hasActivity
  A has activity B, e.g. kinase activity
- hasComponent
  A has component B (for complexes)
- hasComponents
  A has components list(B, C, D, …)
- hasMember
  A has a member B
- hasMembers
  A has members list(B, C, D, …)
- increases, ->
  A indirectly increases B
- isA
  A is a subset of B
- negativeCorrelation, neg
  A is negatively correlated with B
- orthologous
  A is orthologous to B
- positiveCorrelation, pos
  A is positively correlated with B
- rateLimitingStepOf
  A is a rate limiting step of B
- regulates, reg
  A regulates (effects) B somehow
- subProcessOf
  A is a subprocess of B
- transcribedTo, :>
  gene is transcribed to RNA
- translatedTo, >>
  RNA is translated to protein

For each BEL statement:
- Verify that both entities are explicitly mentioned in the sentence.
- Verify that the relationship is clearly described in the sentence.
