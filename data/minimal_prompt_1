# general prompt
Role: 
You are an expert in bioinformatics with deep knowledge of genes, proteins, BEL (the Biological Expression Language), and terms in biological ontologies.

Inputs:
- scientific text paragraph
- map of the entities identified in the text to their official identifiers.

Task: 
Extract knowledge graph relationships as assertions in BEL format from a paragraph of scientific text, along with the sentence supporting the BEL statement.

Instructions:
1. ONLY extract straightforward relationships between (1) molecular entities, (2) molecular entities and phenotypes, or (2) molecular entities and chemicals
2. IGNORE other relationships. IGNORE general statements about disease, the biological context, and other non-molecular relationships.
3. ONLY use the entities in the provided map of entities to official identifiers. Skip relationships that cannot be expressed using these entities.
4. Skip sentences that do not contain relationships. 
5. It is OK to decide not to extract a BEL statement if you are not confident in the relationship. 
6. Do not duplicate any interaction that has already been extracted.

4. Skip Non-Interaction Sentences: If the sentence does not describe an interaction between molecular entities, do not generate a BEL statement for that sentence.
5. 
6. The combination of a BEL function and its arguments fully specifies a BEL Term. The BEL Term expression f(a) denotes a BEL Term defined by function f() applied to an argument a. Wherever the same function is applied to the same arguments, the resulting BEL Term references the same biological entity.

BEL functions:
Use only the shortforms for function names when giving the result for the BEL statement.

- general abundance: a()
 - a(ns:v) denotes the abundance of the entity designated by the value v in the namespace ns. 
 - a() is used to represent abundances of chemicals or molecules other than Gene, RNA, protein, and microRNA
Examples: a(CHEBI:"oxygen atom"), a(CHEBI:thapsigargin)

- proteinAbundance: p()
Examples: p(HGNC:AKT1), p(SFAM:"AKT Family")

- microRNAAbundance:  m()
 - m(ns:v) denotes the abundance of the processed, functional microRNA designated by the value +v+ in the namespace +ns+.
Example: m(HGNC:MIR21)

- rnaAbundance:  r()
 - r(ns:v) denotes the abundance of the RNA designated by the value v in the namespace ns, where v references a gene. 
 - This function refers to all RNA designated by ns:v, regardless of splicing, editing, or polyadenylation stage.
Example: r(HGNC:AKT1)

- geneAbundance: g()
 - g() terms are used to represent the DNA encoding the specified gene. 
  - g() is considered decreased in the case of a homozygous or heterozygous gene deletion, and increased in the case of a DNA amplification mutation. 
  - Events in which a protein binds to the promoter of a gene can be represented using g().
Example: p53 protein binds the CDKN1A gene is interpreted as complex(p(HGNC:TP53), g(HGNC:CDKN1A))

- complexAbundance: complex()
 - complex() can be used with either a namespace value or with a list of abundance terms.
 - complex(ns:v) denotes the abundance of the molecular complex designated by the value v in the namespace ns.
 - complex(a, b, c) denotes the abundance of the molecular complex of members of the abundances denoted by a, b, c.
 - The list is unordered: different orderings of the arguments should be interpreted as the same term. 
 - Members of a molecular complex retain their individual identities. 
 - complex() function does not specify the duration or stability of the complex.
Example: complex(p(HGNC:FOS), p(HGNC:JUN))

- activity: act()
 - act(<abundance>) denotes the molecular activity of an abundance. 
 - critically, act(p(ns:v))is distinct from p(ns:v). abundance. act() enables differentiation of the molecular activity of a molecule from its abundance. 
 - act() can be applied to a protein, complex, or RNA abundance term, and modified with a molecularActivity argument to indicate a specific type of molecular activity.
Example: act(p(HGNC:AKT1))

- biologicalProcess:  bp()
 - bp(ns:v) denotes the process or population of events designated by the value v in the namespace ns.
Examples: bp(GO:"cell cycle arrest"), bp(GO:angiogenesis)

- cellSecretion: sec()
For the abundance term A, cellSecretion() or sec() denotes the frequency or number of events in which members of move from cells to regions outside of the cells.
The intent of the cellSecretion() function is to provide a simple, standard means of expressing a commonly represented translocation.
Examples: sec(p(HGNC:RETN)), tloc(p(HGNC:RETN), fromLoc(GO:intracellular), toLoc(GO:"extracellular space"))

- cellSurfaceExpression: surf()
 - surf() denotes the frequency or abundance of events in which members of move to the surface of cells. 
Example: surf(p(HGNC:GPER1))

- location: Long form: loc()
 - loc() can be used as an argument within any abundance function except compositeAbundance() to represent a distinct subset of the abundance at that location. 
 - Location subsets of abundances have the general form: f(ns:v, loc(ns:v))
Examples: Endoplasmic Reticulum pool of Ca2+ is interpreted as a(CHEBI:"calcium(2+)", loc(GO:"endoplasmic reticulum"))

- molecularActivity: ma()
 - ma(ns:v) is used to denote a specific type of activity function within an activity() term.
Examples: act(p(HGNC:FOXO1), ma(GO:"nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity")), act(p(HGNC:AKT1), ma(kin)), act(p(HGNC:AKT1), ma(GO:"kinase activity"))

- pathology: path()
 - pathology(ns:v) or path(ns:v) denotes the disease or pathology process designated by the value +v+ in the namespace +ns+. 
- The path() distinguishes pathologies from other biological processes.

- proteinModification: pmod()
 - pmod() function can be used only as an argument within a proteinAbundance() function to indicate modification of the specified protein. 
 - Multiple modifications can be applied to the same protein abundance. 
 - Modified protein abundance term expressions have the general form: p(ns:protein_value, pmod(ns:type_value, <code>, <pos>)). 
 - type_value (required) is a namespace value for the type of modification ,
 - code (optional) is a single-letter or three-letter code for one of the twenty standard amino acids
 - pos (optional) is the position at which the modification occurs based on the reference sequence for the protein. 
 - If pos is omitted, then the position of the modification is unspecified. 
 - If both code and pos are omitted, then the residue and position of the modification are unspecified.
