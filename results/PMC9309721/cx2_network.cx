                "description": "AKT1 mediates multiple phosphorylation events that functionally promote HSF1 activation\n\nThe heat stress response activates the transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), which subsequently upregulates heat shock proteins to maintain the integrity of the proteome. HSF1 activation requires nuclear localization, trimerization, DNA binding, phosphorylation and gene transactivation. Phosphorylation at S326 is an important regulator of HSF1 transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation at S326 is mediated by AKT1, mTOR, p38, MEK1 and DYRK2. Here, we observed activation of HSF1 by AKT1 independently of mTOR. AKT2 also phosphorylated S326 of HSF1 but showed weak ability to activate HSF1. Similarly, mTOR, p38, MEK1 and DYRK2 all phosphorylated S326 but AKT1 was the most potent activator. Mass spectrometry showed that AKT1 also phosphorylated HSF1 at T142, S230 and T527 in addition to S326, whereas the other kinases did not. Subsequent investigation revealed that phosphorylation at T142 is necessary for HSF1 trimerization and that S230, S326 and T527 are required for HSF1 gene transactivation and recruitment of TFIIB and CDK9. Interestingly, T527 as a phosphorylated residue has not been previously shown and sits in the transactivation domain, further implying a role for this site in HSF1 gene transactivation. This study suggests that HSF1 hyperphosphorylation is targeted and these specific residues have direct function in regulating HSF1 transcriptional activity.",

HSF1 activation requires nuclear localization, trimerization, DNA binding, phosphorylation and gene transactivation. Phosphorylation at S326 is an important regulator of HSF1 transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation at S326 is mediated by AKT1, mTOR, p38, MEK1 and DYRK2. Here, we observed activation of HSF1 by AKT1 independently of mTOR. AKT2 also phosphorylated S326 of HSF1 but showed weak ability to activate HSF1. Similarly, mTOR, p38, MEK1 and DYRK2 all phosphorylated S326 but AKT1 was the most potent activator. Mass spectrometry showed that AKT1 also phosphorylated HSF1 at T142, S230 and T527 in addition to S326, whereas the other kinases did not. Subsequent investigation revealed that phosphorylation at T142 is necessary for HSF1 trimerization and that S230, S326 and T527 are required for HSF1 gene transactivation and recruitment of TFIIB and CDK9. Interestingly, T527 as a phosphorylated residue has not been previously shown and sits in the transactivation domain, further implying a role for this site in HSF1 gene transactivation. This study suggests that HSF1 hyperphosphorylation is targeted and these specific residues have direct function in regulating HSF1 transcriptional activity.",

HSF1 activation requires nuclear localization, trimerization, DNA binding, phosphorylation and gene transactivation. Phosphorylation at S326 is an important regulator of HSF1 transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation at S326 is mediated by AKT1, mTOR, p38, MEK1 and DYRK2. Here, we observed activation of HSF1 by AKT1 independently of mTOR. AKT2 also phosphorylated S326 of HSF1 but showed weak ability to activate HSF1. Similarly, mTOR, p38, MEK1 and DYRK2 all phosphorylated S326 but AKT1 was the most potent activator. Mass spectrometry showed that AKT1 also phosphorylated HSF1 at T142, S230 and T527 in addition to S326, whereas the other kinases did not. Subsequent investigation revealed that phosphorylation at T142 is necessary for HSF1 trimerization and that S230, S326 and T527 are required for HSF1 gene transactivation and recruitment of TFIIB and CDK9. Interestingly, T527 as a phosphorylated residue has not been previously shown and sits in the transactivation domain, further implying a role for this site in HSF1 gene transactivation. This study suggests that HSF1 hyperphosphorylation is targeted and these specific residues have direct function in regulating HSF1 transcriptional activity.",

To assess this possibility, either AKT1, AKT2 or AKT3 were introduced into multiple cell lines along with a luciferase reporter driven by the presence of two heat shock elements (HSEs). Consistent with our previous findings, AKT1 strongly induced HSF1 activity (Fig. 1A-C). AKT2 promoted a significant increase in HSF1 activity, but the effect was modest while AKT3 had no significant effect on HSF1 activity (Fig. 1A-C). To determine the ability of the AKT isoforms to phosphorylate HSF1 at S326, a key phosphorylation event critical for HSF1 activity, an in vitro kinase assay followed by immunoblotting was performed with each AKT isoform. Both AKT1 and AKT2 phosphorylated S326 of HSF1 at similar levels but AKT3 showed no capability for phosphorylating S326 (Fig. 1D). These results seem contradictory because AKT2 phosphorylated S326, but the level of phosphorylation far exceeded the HSF1 activity induced by AKT2 (Fig. 1A-D). However, we also observed that AKT2 did not phosphorylate S326 as strongly in cells (Fig. 1E), suggesting that AKT2 has the capability to phosphorylate HSF1 but this is more limited within living cells. AKT1 is also a well-known activator of mTOR and mTOR has been shown to phosphorylate HSF1 at S326 in response to proteotoxic stress. Therefore, to determine whether AKT1-driven HSF1 activity and S326 phosphorylation is mediated by mTOR, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of rapamycin and subjected to the HSE luciferase reporter assay or immunoblotting with p-HSF1 S326 antibodies. Results indicated that rapamycin had no effect on HSF1 activity (Fig. 1F) or on S326 phosphorylation (Fig. 1G) driven by AKT1. We further assessed whether the AKT isoforms affected downstream activation steps of HSF1, including trimerization and DNA binding. Introduction of AKT1 was observed to promote a significant increase in trimerization, although the AKT1-driven trimerization was not as much as heat stress (Fig. 2A-B). AKT2 and AKT3 promoted on minimal amounts of HSF1 trimerization (Fig. 2A-B). Similarly, introduction of AKT1 promoted a significant increase of HSF1 binding to putative targets HSPA1A (HSP70), HSPA8 (HSP73) and HSPD1 (HSP60), whereas AKT2 and AKT3 had no significant effect on HSF1 binding (Fig. 2C). To confirm whether DNA binding of HSF1 resulted in gene transactivation, we further assessed expression of HSP70 and HSP90, well-known HSF1 target genes, in response to expression of AKT1, AKT2 or AKT3. Both HSP70 and HSP70 expression were seen to increase more in response to AKT1 than other isoforms (Fig. 2D-E). We did not observe any effect of AKT1 on HSF1 protein half-life (Fig. S1). These results indicate that AKT1 is the primary AKT isoform capable of activating HSF1 with AKT2 having modest effects in cells.",

However, phosphorylation by these different kinases resulted in varying degrees of HSF1 transcriptional activity with AKT1 promoting higher activity than the other kinases. To resolve this apparent contradiction, we reasoned that AKT1 may be phosphorylating additional residues that support HSF1 activation. To test this hypothesis, recombinant HSF1 was subjected to a kinase assay with either AKT1, AKT2, p38, mTOR, MEK1 or DYRK2 as performed in Figures 1D and 4A, followed by mass spectrometry to identify novel phosphorylation sites (Fig. 6A). Results from this phosphorylation scan are summarized in Fig. 6B and Table S1, which illustrates the phosphorylation sites outside the known target of S326. AKT1 phosphorylated T142, S230 and T527. Interestingly, these sites were entirely unique to AKT1 as only MEK1 was seen to phosphorylate any of these sites by phosphorylating T527. All four of these sites, including S326, are conserved across several mammalian species (Fig. 6C). Phosphorylation at T142 has only been reported once and this was mediated by CK2. Phosphorylation at S230 has been previously reported and was shown to promote inducible HSF1 activity and has also previously been shown to be phosphorylated by AKT1. Phosphorylation at T527 has never been reported. Phospho-null mutations to alanine at each of these sites individually resulted in some variable effects with S326A and S230A having no significant effect of HSF1 activity in response to heat stress (Fig. 6D). T142A and T527A individually showed a small but significant decrease in HSF1 activity in response to heat stress (Fig. 6D). However, when all four of these sites were mutated to alanine, HSF1 no longer responded to heat stress (Fig. 6E). Phospho-mimic mutants for these residues showed highly variable results with little evidence that T/S->E/D mutations were sufficiently mimicking phosphorylation, thus rendering these mutants unusable as a reliable phospho-mimic (Fig. S2). These results indicate that AKT1 modifies HSF1 in a unique pattern by phosphorylating T142, S230 and T527 in addition to S326. This unique pattern of phosphorylation may mechanistically explain why AKT1 promotes HSF1 activity more potently than these other kinases.

Should these additional phosphorylation sites mediate the additional HSF1 activity observed in the presence of AKT1, it stands to reason that these sites functionally participate in the activation process of HSF1. Therefore, the role of each of these four phosphorylation sites in the process of HSF1 activation was investigated. Threonine 142 sits in the first leucine-zipper domain, also referred to as the heptad repeat domain, and this domain is responsible for trimerization of HSF1. Considering T142 is located in this domain, it was tested whether phosphorylation at this site affected trimerization. Introduction of AKT1 with wild-type (WT)-HSF1 resulted in an increase in trimerization, which was lost in the presence of the T142A phospho-null mutant (Fig. 7A). To test whether T142 regulation of trimerization was AKT1 specific, HSF1 trimerization was also tested in the presence of CK2, which has previously been observed to phosphorylate T142. In the presence of CK2, WT-HSF1 also showed a significant increase in trimerization but T142A-HSF1 did not undergo trimerization in the presence of CK2 (Fig. 7B). These results likely indicate that phosphorylation at T142 is an important regulatory step of HSF1 trimerization and is not AKT1 specific. To further assess the oligomeric state of HSF1 and the role of T142, gel filtration chromatography was performed on lysates expressing either WT-HSF1 or T142A-HSF1 with or without the presence of AKT1. When fractions from WT-HSF1-expressing cells were blotted for HSF1, it was found to elute in the lower molecular weight range, consistent with the molecular weight that HSF1 monomers migrate at approximately 70-80 kDa (Fig. 7C). In the presence of AKT1, HSF1 was found in earlier-eluting fractions with a predicted molecular weight range indicative of trimers.

We observed similar results with mRNA levels of HSP70, a direct transcriptional target of HSF1 (Fig. S3A-C), suggesting that this phosphorylation site may be involved in interaction with CDK9 and TFIIB. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed a loss of interaction between T527A-HSF1 with CDK9 and TFIIB (Fig. 8D-E), suggesting that phosphorylation at this site is critical for this protein complex formation.",

In order for HSF1 to become transcriptionally active, it must overcome cytoplasmic sequestration followed by nuclear localization, trimerization, DNA binding, phosphorylation and gene transactivation. The regulation of HSF1 activity by phosphorylation has been debated but what is generally accepted is that S326 phosphorylation is important for HSF1 activity, a site that was initially identified from an HSF1 phospho-null screen. Considering the importance of S326 phosphorylation, a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating phosphorylation at this residue would likely provide insight on how to manipulate HSF1 activity in disease conditions wherein HSF1 is dysregulated. Phosphorylation at S326 has been shown to be mediated by several kinases, including mTORC1, AKT1, MEK1, p38 and DYRK2. The current study additionally indicates that AKT2 has the capability to phosphorylate S326 (Fig. 1). The involvement of these kinases appears to be context dependent. The current study indicated that the context-dependent nature of these kinases may stem from the unique pattern of residues phosphorylated by each kinase. This study indicates that mTORC1, MEK1, p38 and DYRK2 induce HSF1 activity to a similar level but phosphorylate HSF1 primarily at S326 as well as S363, a known inhibitory site, S221, also thought to be an inhibitory site, or at S241 and S344, which are two novel phosphorylation sites with unknown function. However, AKT1 appeared to be a more potent inducer of HSF1 activity that likely stems from its ability to phosphorylate an additional three residues identified here that all functionally promote HSF1 activation. The PI3K pathway has been linked to HSF1 activity as far back as 2000 but whether this was an indirect regulation or a direct regulation was unclear until our previous study indicating AKT1 directly activates HSF1. The current study indicates that AKT1 also participates in heat stress-induced activation of HSF1 (Fig. 2) and that AKT1-mediated activation is independent of mTORC1 (Fig. 1).

A more recent study indicated that an HSF1 mutant wherein all of the serine residues within the regulatory domain are phospho-null has greater activity compared to WT-HSF1 and this mutant did not undergo classic hyperphosphorylation, suggesting that hyperphosphorylation is actually suppressive to HSF1 activity. There were also early indications that extensive phosphorylation can suppress HSF1 activity. However, results from the current study indicate that phosphorylation on specific residues enhance HSF1 transcriptional activity by mediating specific steps in the process of activation. Thus, it seems that the model for HSF1 activation involves phosphorylation at specific residues but then hyperphosphorylation leads to inactivation of HSF1. This model would presume that activation phosphorylation events occur prior to hyperphosphorylation, although there is currently no published evidence for this temporal relationship. This model is also supported by the numerous studies indicating that specific phosphorylation on S326 is important for HSF1 activity. While this model is intriguing as a potential negative feedback on HSF1, the mechanism for hyperphosphorylation, and associated kinases involved, remain to be uncovered.",

This result is particularly interesting when considering many of the known mechanisms that regulate HSF1 protein levels would be predicted to cause degradation of HSF1 in the presence of rapamycin. These degradation mechanisms include p300-mediated acetylation stabilizing HSF1, SIRT1-mediated de-acetylation of HSF1 stabilizing HSF1 and FBXW7-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of HSF1. One possibility for our observation could be because rapamycin has been shown to have varying effects on ERK1/2 activity depending on the dose. ERK1/2 (and GSK3beta)-mediated phosphorylation at S303/307 recruits the ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 to promote HSF1 degradation. Because of the dose-dependent effects of rapamycin on ERK1/2 activity, it is possible that rapamycin decreased ERK1/2 activity in these cells, thereby decreasing FBXW7-mediated degradation of HSF1 resulting in stabilization of HSF1. It is also possible that rapamycin promoted enough of a cellular stress response that resulted in feedback to promote HSF1 protein stability and/or expression. The current study also identified that mTOR can phosphorylate three additional residues aside from S326 that include S221, S241 and S344, all of which are in the HSF1 regulatory domain. Phosphorylation at S221 and S241 on HSF1 has never been reported and the specific role of S344 phosphorylation remains unclear. Therefore, it is possible that the rapamycin effect is a result of blocking phosphorylation at one of these sites that has a resulting effect to increase HSF1 protein levels.
