Rat bladder 804G cells expressing either a recombinant full-length human \u03b24 subunit (clone A) or a tail-less version (clone L) were cross-linked in suspension with the anti-\u03b24 Mab 3E1 or the control anti-MHC Mab W6.32. Immunoprecipitation with the 3E1 Mab followed by immunoblotting with anti-Shc antibodies revealed that the recruitment of all three isoforms of Shc by \u03b16\u03b24 requires the cytoplasmic domain of the \u03b24 subunit. To examine if recruitment to \u03b16\u03b24 was a prerequisite for tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, clone A and clone L were either cross-linked in suspension with the 3E1 or the W6.32 Mab or plated onto dishes coated with the same antibodies. Immunoprecipitation with anti-Shc antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr antibodies indicated that ligation of wild-type \u03b16\u03b24 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the 52 kDa isoform of Shc (the major isoform recruited to activated \u03b16\u03b24 in these cells). In contrast, ligation of tail-less \u03b16\u03b24 did not cause efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the recruitment of Shc to activated \u03b16\u03b24 is mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of \u03b24. They also suggest that this event is necessary for subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein. Since in a number of experiments tail-less \u03b16\u03b24 was able to induce a modest level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, it is possible that an additional indirect mechanism contributes to the activation of Shc by \u03b16\u03b24.",

Upon plating on dishes coated with poly-L-lysine or laminin 5, the cells were either left untreated or exposed to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). The results of luciferase assays indicated that adhesion to laminin 5 causes elevation of Fos SRE-dependent transcription in the \u03b24 transfectants even in the absence of mitogens and this induction is potentiated by mitogen treatment. The ability of laminin 5 to induce Fos SRE-dependent transcription was dependent on \u03b16\u03b24 expression, because adhesion to laminin 5 did not cause this effect in control cells even after mitogen treatment. These results indicate that ligation of \u03b16\u03b24, but not \u03b13\u03b21, is sufficient to induce Fos SRE-dependent transcription, and confirm that \u03b16\u03b24 cooperates with mitogens to cause optimal induction of this activity.",

Previous studies have indicated that the cell cycle of normal cells contains an anchorage-dependent transition in early\u2013mid G1. In fact, adhesion to the extracellular matrix is required for translation of cyclin D1 in cells exposed to mitogens, suggesting that integrin- and growth factor-dependent signals converge prior to the induction of cyclin D1 to control progression through G1. Our results suggest that these signals are integrated before the induction of immediate-early gene expression. The simplest hypothesis is that in normal cells growth factor receptors and specific integrins cooperate to activate MAP kinase beyond the threshold level required for immediate-early gene expression. Since most dominant oncogenes, including Shc, induce neoplastic transformation by constitutively activating the Ras\u2013MAP kinase pathway, this model also explains why neoplastic cells usually display anchorage-independent growth.",
