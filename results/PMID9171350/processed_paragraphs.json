While the stimulation of Erk by \u03b16\u03b24 was suppressed by dominant-negative Shc, Ras and RhoA, the activation of Jnk was inhibited by dominant-negative Ras and Rac1 and by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor Wortmannin. Adhesion mediated by \u03b16\u03b24 induced transcription from the Fos serum response element and promoted cell cycle progression in response to mitogens.

Since the tail-less integrin binds efficiently to extracellular ligand, its dominant-negative effect is likely to result from its ability to co-cluster with the endogenous wild-type receptor and block a signal necessary for hemidesmosome assembly. In accordance with this hypothesis, recent studies have revealed that \u03b16\u03b24 is associated with an intracellular tyrosine kinase. Mutagenesis experiments have provided evidence that the phosphorylation of a tyrosine activation motif (TAM) located in the connecting segment controls the association of \u03b16\u03b24 with the hemidesmosomal cytoskeleton, presumably via the recruitment of a signaling molecule containing two tandem Src homology 2 (SH2) domains."

        "text": "In contrast to the recruitment of Shc and Grb2 which could be observed in suspended keratinocytes cross-linked with anti-\u03b16\u03b24 antibodies, full activation of Ras required physical attachment and/or spreading on a substratum coated with \u03b16\u03b24 ligands. Since it has been suggested that proper targeting of the Grb2\u2013mSOS complex to Ras may require an interaction of the Grb2 SH3 domains with the cortical cytoskeleton, it is possible that such targeting is defective in suspended keratinocytes cross-linked with anti-\u03b16\u03b24 antibodies. Alternatively, since the pleckstrin homology domain of mSOS may bind to phosphatidylinositol(4,5)bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) in the plasma membrane and it is known that PtdInsP2 levels decline in suspended cells, it is possible that Ras activation by \u03b16\u03b24 requires a threshold concentration of PtdInsP2 in the plasma membrane which is not available in suspended keratinocytes. Future studies will be required to resolve this issue."

        "text": "The results of this study indicate that ligation of \u03b16\u03b24 results in the stimulation of both Ras\u2013Erk and Rac\u2013Jnk MAP kinase signaling pathways. The activation of Erk by \u03b16\u03b24 was suppressed by dominant-negative versions of both Shc and Ras, indicating that the coupling to Ras mediated by Shc is the major mechanism by which \u03b16\u03b24 controls Erk activation. Interestingly, Erk activation was also inhibited by dominant-negative RhoA. This result, which is in agreement with the recent observation that Rho activity is required for full activation of Erk in response to various extracellular stimuli, suggests that this G protein also participates in signaling by \u03b16\u03b24. The activation of Jnk by \u03b16\u03b24 was inhibited by dominant-negative Ras and Rac1, but not by dominant-negative RhoA and Cdc42. In addition, it was suppressed by nanomolar concentrations of the PI-3K inhibitor Wortmannin. Since there is evidence that PI-3K is a downstream target effector of Ras and is involved in the activation of Rac, it is likely that \u03b16\u03b24 stimulates the Rac\u2013Jnk pathway via Ras. Thus, the coupling of \u03b16\u03b24 to Ras mediated by Shc leads to the activation of both Ras\u2013Erk and Rac\u2013Jnk signaling pathways."

        "text": "In accordance with the observation that Erk stimulates transcription of the immediate-early gene fos, the results of our study indicate that adhesion mediated by \u03b16\u03b24 is sufficient to promote transcription from the Fos SRE. Interestingly, while treatment with mitogens caused a significant elevation of Fos SRE activity in cells plated on the \u03b16\u03b24 ligand laminin 5, it was ineffective in cells adhering to the \u03b12\u03b21 ligand collagen I, indicating that the expression of Fos in response to mitogens requires ligation of a specific integrin, such as \u03b16\u03b24. Future studies will be required to examine further the mechanism by which \u03b16\u03b24 controls immediate-early gene expression. For example, it is known that Rho family proteins can activate the Fos promoter by stimulating the serum response factor. The ability of \u03b16\u03b24 to stimulate Rac may thus contribute to the activation of Fos promoter in response to laminin 5. In addition, since it is well established that Jnk controls the activity of the Jun promoter, it is likely that \u03b16\u03b24 also regulates the expression of the immediate-early expression gene Jun. Taken together, these observations suggest that \u03b16\u03b24 is a crucial regulator of immediate-early gene expression."

The results of our cell proliferation analysis indicate that \u03b16\u03b24 signaling promotes transit through G1 in keratinocytes and other \u03b16\u03b24-expressing cells exposed to mitogens. In this respect, \u03b16\u03b24 appears to be functionally distinct from other integrins, such as \u03b13\u03b21 and \u03b12\u03b21, which do not appear to be able to do so. In fact, it is quite remarkable that keratinocytes plated on the \u03b12\u03b21 ligand collagen I adhere and spread but do not enter into the S phase despite being exposed to otherwise mitogenic concentrations of EGF. We have observed recently that a class of \u03b21 and \u03b1v integrins, which include \u03b11\u03b21, \u03b15\u03b21 and \u03b1v\u03b23, but not \u03b12\u03b21, \u03b13\u03b21 and \u03b16\u03b21, are also linked to the Ras\u2013Erk pathway and the control of cell cycle progression by Shc. Taken together, these observations suggest that the ability of extracellular matrix to control cell proliferation, thereby mediating anchorage-dependent cell growth, depends on its composition and the repertoire of integrins on the responding cell."

        "text": "What is the mechanism by which \u03b16\u03b24 signaling regulates cell proliferation? Previous studies have indicated that the cell cycle of normal cells contains an anchorage-dependent transition in early\u2013mid G1. In fact, adhesion to the extracellular matrix is required for translation of cyclin D1 in cells exposed to mitogens, suggesting that integrin- and growth factor-dependent signals converge prior to the induction of cyclin D1 to control progression through G1. Our results suggest that these signals are integrated before the induction of immediate-early gene expression. The simplest hypothesis is that in normal cells growth factor receptors and specific integrins cooperate to activate MAP kinase beyond the threshold level required for immediate-early gene expression. Since most dominant oncogenes, including Shc, induce neoplastic transformation by constitutively activating the Ras\u2013MAP kinase pathway, this model also explains why neoplastic cells usually display anchorage-independent growth."

Since the major keratinocyte integrins, in addition to \u03b16\u03b24, are \u03b12\u03b21 and \u03b13\u03b21, which are not coupled to Shc, the signaling function of \u03b16\u03b24 may explain why cell proliferation is restricted to the basal layer in the epidermis and other stratified epithelia. In addition, since exit from the cell cycle is a prerequisite for differentiation, our results may also explain why the onset of keratinocyte differentiation is coupled to the detachment from the basement membrane. Finally, the ability of \u03b16\u03b24 to stimulate cell growth suggests that its overexpression in squamous carcinoma may contribute to tumor progression."
