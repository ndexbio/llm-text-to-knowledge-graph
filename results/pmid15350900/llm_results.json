In solid tumours, HIFa is stabilised under conditions of low oxygen due to a lack of vascularisation and the subsequent evolution of a hypoxic microenvironment. In a VHL-null tumour, HIFa is constitutively active, and can initiate genetic programmes within the entire population of cells that would normally be activated only under hypoxic conditions.",
