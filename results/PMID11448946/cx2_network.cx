We investigated the roles of E-selectin and of stress-activated protein kinase-2 (SAPK2/p38) in modulating endothelial adhesion and transendothelial migration of HT-29 colon carcinoma cells. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) strongly increased the expression of E-selectin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). This effect was independent of the activation of SAPK2/p38 induced by TNF. Adhesion of HT-29 cells on a monolayer of HUVEC pretreated with TNF was dependent on E-selectin expression but was independent of SAPK2/p38 activity of both HUVEC and tumor cells. The adhesion of HT-29 cells to E-selectin-expressing HUVEC led to the activation of SAPK2/p38 in the tumor cells as reflected by the increased phosphorylation of the actin-polymerizing factor HSP27 by mitogen-activated protein kinase 2/3, a direct target of SAPK2/p38. Moreover, a recombinant E-selectin/Fc chimera quickly increased the activation of SAPK2/p38 in HT-29 cells. Blocking the increased activity of SAPK2/p38 of HT-29 cells by SB203580 or by expressing a dominant negative form of SAPK2/p38 inhibited their transendothelial migration. Similarly, HeLa cells stably expressing a kinase-inactive mutant of SAPK2/p38 showed a decreased capacity to cross a layer of HUVEC. Overall, our results suggest that the regulation of transendothelial migration of tumor cells involves two essential steps as follows: adhesion to the endothelium through adhesion molecules, such as E-selectin, and increased motogenic potential through adhesion-mediated activation of the SAPK2/p38 pathway.",

We investigated the roles of E-selectin and of stress-activated protein kinase-2 (SAPK2/p38) in modulating endothelial adhesion and transendothelial migration of HT-29 colon carcinoma cells. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) strongly increased the expression of E-selectin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). This effect was independent of the activation of SAPK2/p38 induced by TNF. Adhesion of HT-29 cells on a monolayer of HUVEC pretreated with TNF was dependent on E-selectin expression but was independent of SAPK2/p38 activity of both HUVEC and tumor cells. The adhesion of HT-29 cells to E-selectin-expressing HUVEC led to the activation of SAPK2/p38 in the tumor cells as reflected by the increased phosphorylation of the actin-polymerizing factor HSP27 by mitogen-activated protein kinase 2/3, a direct target of SAPK2/p38. Moreover, a recombinant E-selectin/Fc chimera quickly increased the activation of SAPK2/p38 in HT-29 cells. Blocking the increased activity of SAPK2/p38 of HT-29 cells by SB203580 or by expressing a dominant negative form of SAPK2/p38 inhibited their transendothelial migration. Similarly, HeLa cells stably expressing a kinase-inactive mutant of SAPK2/p38 showed a decreased capacity to cross a layer of HUVEC. Overall, our results suggest that the regulation of transendothelial migration of tumor cells involves two essential steps as follows: adhesion to the endothelium through adhesion molecules, such as E-selectin, and increased motogenic potential through adhesion-mediated activation of the SAPK2/p38 pathway.",

We thus verified whether E-selectin-mediated adhesion was required for the migration of tumor cells across an endothelial layer separating the upper and lower compartments of a Boyden-modified chamber. HT-29 cells have by themselves a very low motogenic potential, being unable to traverse a polycarbonate membrane, even following the addition of FBS in the lower chamber. However, HT-29 cells migrated across an endothelial layer of HUVEC, and this migration was enhanced by pretreating HUVEC with TNF. This increase in cell migration was reduced down to control levels by pretreating HUVEC with the anti-E-selectin antibody indicating the requirement of E-selectin expression and E-selectin-dependent adhesion for HT-29 cell migration across an endothelial cell layer.",

HT-29 cells were transiently transfected with Myc-tagged human HSP27 and LT-tagged MAPKAP K2 and then were put in suspension and added to plastic only (Petri dish), to control HUVEC or to HUVEC-expressing E-selectin following activation with TNF. Thirty minutes after adhesion, cell extracts were prepared from adhering cells, and phosphorylation of HSP27 was evaluated by IEF electrophoresis to separate the four major isoforms of HSP27, A\u2014D, that represent unphosphorylated, monophosphorylated, biphosphorylated, and triphosphorylated variants of the protein. Results showed that adhesion of HT-29 cells to HUVEC-expressing E-selectin was associated with a 3.5-fold increase in the proportion of phosphorylated C form in comparison with the proportion of C form found in HT-29 cells that have adhered to plastic or to untreated HUVEC. This was associated with a proportionally significant decrease in the amount of the unphosphorylated A form in the HT-29 cells adhering to E-selectin-expressing HUVEC. Phosphorylated B form was present in any of the adhering conditions, but its proportion did not vary. Expression of E-selectin in HUVEC has been induced by pretreating the cells for 90 min with 10 ng/ml TNF followed by a medium change and a further 2.5-h incubation in fresh medium. Hence, it is possible that a fraction of TNF exogenously added to HUVEC to trigger synthesis of E-selectin remained bound to HUVEC or in solution in the fresh culture medium at the time of adding HT-29 cells to activated HUVEC. Since TNF activated SAPK2/p38 in HT-29 cells, we thus considered the eventuality that residual TNF contributed to increase the phosphorylation of HSP27 in the adherent HT-29 cells. To exclude this possibility, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Quantikine from R & D Systems) were performed to detect TNF bound to HUVEC as well as remaining in the fresh culture medium. We found that only trace amounts of TNF (4.2 pg/5 x 10^5 cells) were associated with HUVEC, whereas 0.25 ng/ml were found in the fresh culture medium. In both cases, these concentrations were below the minimal concentration of TNF (0.5 \u00b5g/ml) that was required to activate SAPK2/p38 in HT-29 cells. We thus concluded that was unlikely that residual TNF was involved in activating SAPK2/p38 in HT-29 cells adhering to HUVEC. Accordingly, addition of a neutralizing anti-TNF, in concentration (0.5 \u00b5g/ml) that totally inhibited the activation of SAPK2/p38 by 1 ng/ml TNF, did not impair the increased phosphorylation of HSP27 in HT-29 adhering to HUVEC. These results support the hypothesis that the E-selectin-dependent adhesion of HT-29 tumor cells to endothelial cells activates the SAPK2/p38-HSP27 pathway in the tumor cells. In fact, the activity of SAPK2/p38 of HT-29 cells was quickly increased by adhesion of the cells to immobilized recombinant human E-selectin/Fc chimera. Reciprocally, addition of recombinant human E-selectin/Fc chimera, in concentrations (1 \u00b5g/ml) that increased adhesion of HT-29 by 10-fold in comparison to bovine serum albumin controls, activated in these cells the SAPK2/38 in a time-dependent manner with a peak of activation of 6.5-fold after 5 min. Together, these findings indicate that E-selectin did not only mediate the adhesion of HT-29 cells to HUVEC but that it could also act as agonistic ligand that activated the SAPK2/p38-HSP27 motogenic pathway in the tumor cells.",

The role of SAPK2/p38 as a motogenic pathway in tumor cells was further supported by the finding that HeLa cells stably expressing a kinase-inactive mutant form of SAPK2/p38 had a lower capacity than the parental cells to migrate across a monolayer of HUVEC. Intriguingly, the adhesion of both types of HeLa cells was not increased when added to HUVEC stimulated with TNF. These findings confirmed the results that SAPK2/p38 was not involved in mediating adhesion of cancer cells to HUVEC, and they indicated that, conversely to HT-29 cells, adhesion of HeLa cells to HUVEC did not require the expression of E-selectin or of other adhesion molecules that depend on TNF exposure.

A major conclusion of our study is to provide evidence that E-selectin-mediated adhesion of HT-29 tumor cells to HUVEC increased the activity of the motogenic SAPK2/p38 pathway of the tumor cells enabling their transendothelial migration. Two lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, addition of HT-29 cells to HUVEC-expressing E-selectin led to an increased phosphorylation of HSP27, as indicated by the significantly enhanced amount of HSP27-phosphorylated C form in the HT-29 cells that adhered to TNF-treated HUVEC in comparison to those that adhered only to plastic or to untreated HUVEC. HSP27 is an actin-polymerizing factor whose phosphorylation downstream of the SAPK2/p38 pathway contributes with FAK phosphorylation to induce the actin reorganization that is required for cell migration. Second, inhibiting SAPK2/p38 activity and phosphorylation of HSP27 of HT-29 cells with SB203580 or with an inactive kinase mutant of SAPK2/p38 resulted in an inhibition of the transendothelial migration of the tumor cells. The finding that recombinant human E-selectin/Fc chimera activates SAPK2/p38 indicates that E-selectin acts as an agonist that binds to counter-receptors at the surface of tumor cells to initiate a cascade of events leading to SAPK2/p38 activation. The tumor cells binding to E-selectin involves oligosaccharides such as sialyl Lewis a and x presented by counter-receptors for E-selectin. Binding of E-selectin to these receptors initiates signaling events involving tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins. One such potential E-selectin receptor on HT-29 cells might be E-selectin ligand-1, a member of the fibroblast growth factor tyrosine kinase receptor family that is expressed by various tumor cell lines including myeloid cells. SAPK2/p38 is strongly activated by VEGF binding to VEGFR2, another tyrosine kinase receptor. E-selectin ligand-1 is thus possibly implicated as a counter-receptor responsible for binding of E-selectin and for transmitting the signal that triggers activation of SAPK2/p38. The capacity of selectins to activate SAPK2/p38 has recently been reported in a study that showed that clustering of L-selectin in neutrophils activates SAPK2/p38, which triggers neutrophil degranulation. It remains possible that a secondary adhesion molecule could contribute with E-selectin to trigger adhesion-mediated signaling to SAPK2/p38. In this context, the role of ICAM that is co-expressed with E-selectin in endothelial cells activated by TNF remains to be investigated. Integrins are importantly involved in transducing signals initiated by cell-cell adhesion. For example, tumor cell-bound \u03b14 integrin strengthens adhesion of tumor cells to the endothelium and promotes transendothelial migration. Moreover, activation of SAPK2/p38 by adhesion of osteosarcoma cells onto collagen is mediated by \u03b12\u03b21 integrin.

                    "text": "Two mechanisms may underlie the metastatic development in response to adhesion of tumor cells to the endothelium as follows: intravascular proliferation of attached tumor cells or extravasation of these cells. In the latter case, this implicates numerous factors that may work separately or in combination. This implies among others that circulating tumor cells have a higher intrinsic motogenic potential, that they respond to circulating motogenic signals, or that contact of tumor cells with endothelial cells activates the motogenic potential of the tumor cells. A major conclusion of our study is to provide evidence that E-selectin-mediated adhesion of HT-29 tumor cells to HUVEC increased the activity of the motogenic SAPK2/p38 pathway of the tumor cells enabling their transendothelial migration. Two lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, addition of HT-29 cells to HUVEC-expressing E-selectin led to an increased phosphorylation of HSP27, as indicated by the significantly enhanced amount of HSP27-phosphorylated C form in the HT-29 cells that adhered to TNF-treated HUVEC in comparison to those that adhered only to plastic or to untreated HUVEC. HSP27 is an actin-polymerizing factor whose phosphorylation downstream of the SAPK2/p38 pathway contributes with FAK phosphorylation to induce the actin reorganization that is required for cell migration. Second, inhibiting SAPK2/p38 activity and phosphorylation of HSP27 of HT-29 cells with SB203580 or with an inactive kinase mutant of SAPK2/p38 resulted in an inhibition of the transendothelial migration of the tumor cells. The finding that recombinant human E-selectin/Fc chimera activates SAPK2/p38 indicates that E-selectin acts as an agonist that binds to counter-receptors at the surface of tumor cells to initiate a cascade of events leading to SAPK2/p38 activation. The tumor cells binding to E-selectin involves oligosaccharides such as sialyl Lewis a and x presented by counter-receptors for E-selectin. Binding of E-selectin to these receptors initiates signaling events involving tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins. One such potential E-selectin receptor on HT-29 cells might be E-selectin ligand-1, a member of the fibroblast growth factor tyrosine kinase receptor family that is expressed by various tumor cell lines including myeloid cells. SAPK2/p38 is strongly activated by VEGF binding to VEGFR2, another tyrosine kinase receptor. E-selectin ligand-1 is thus possibly implicated as a counter-receptor responsible for binding of E-selectin and for transmitting the signal that triggers activation of SAPK2/p38. The capacity of selectins to activate SAPK2/p38 has recently been reported in a study that showed that clustering of L-selectin in neutrophils activates SAPK2/p38, which triggers neutrophil degranulation. It remains possible that a secondary adhesion molecule could contribute with E-selectin to trigger adhesion-mediated signaling to SAPK2/p38. In this context, the role of ICAM that is co-expressed with E-selectin in endothelial cells activated by TNF remains to be investigated. Integrins are importantly involved in transducing signals initiated by cell-cell adhesion. For example, tumor cell-bound \u03b14 integrin strengthens adhesion of tumor cells to the endothelium and promotes transendothelial migration. Moreover, activation of SAPK2/p38 by adhesion of osteosarcoma cells onto collagen is mediated by \u03b12\u03b21 integrin. Thus, integrins may act jointly with selectins to regulate the SAPK2/p38-mediated motogenic signal elicited in tumor cells when they adhere to endothelial cells.",
