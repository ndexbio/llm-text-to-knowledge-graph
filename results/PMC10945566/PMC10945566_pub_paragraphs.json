Neuromodulators generate intracellular Ca2+ signals by stimulation of cognate G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) linked to the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and Ca2+ signalling pathway. IP3 transduces intracellular Ca2+ release through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localised ligand-gated ion channel, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), followed by store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) through the plasma membrane localised Orai channel. Cellular and physiological consequences of Ca2+ signals generated through SOCE exhibit different timescales and subcellular localisation from activity-induced signals, suggesting that they alter neuronal properties through novel mechanisms.",

        "text": "Expression studies, genetics, and physiological analysis support a role for IP3/Ca2+ and SOCE in neuronal development and the regulation of adult neuronal physiology across organisms. In Drosophila, neuromodulatory signals of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides stimulate cognate GPCRs on specific neurons to generate IP3 followed by intracellular Ca2+ release and SOCE. Genetic and cellular studies identified neuromodulatory inputs and SOCE as an essential component for maturation of neural circuits for flight. A focus of this flight deficit lies in a group of central dopaminergic neurons (DANs) that include the PPL1 and PPM3 DANs marked by THD' GAL4, alternately referred to henceforth as flight-promoting DANs (fpDANs). Among the fpDANs, some PPL1 DANs project to the gamma2alpha'1 lobe of the mushroom body (MB), a dense region of neuropil in the insect central brain, that forms a relay centre for flight. Axonal projections from Kenyon cells (KCs) carry sensory inputs and those from DANs carry internal state information to functional compartments of the MB, where dopamine release modulates the KC and MB output neuron synapse (MBONs). The KC-DAN-MBON tripartite synapse carries a dynamically updating representation of the motivational and behavioural state of the animal. Here, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms that underlie the ability of neuromodulatory acetylcholine signals, acting through SOCE during circuit maturation, to determine fpDAN function required for Drosophila flight.",

These include a smaller subset of THD'GAL4 marked DANs, where acetylcholine promotes dopamine release through the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAchR) by stimulating IP3/Ca2+ signalling. OraiE180A expression in a subset of 21-23 DANs marked by THD' GAL4 (Figure 1B) led to complete loss of flight (Figure 1C) while overexpression of the wildtype Orai transgene had a relatively minor effect (Figure 1:figure supplement 1).",

It is known that THD'-marked PPL1 DANs receive cholinergic inputs that stimulate store Ca2+ release through the IP3R, leading to SOCE through Orai (Figure 3A). In support of this idea, either expression of OraiE180A or knockdown of the IP3R attenuated the composite ER-Ca2+ release plus SOCE response to carbachol (CCh), a mAChR agonist, in PPL1 DANs (Figure 3B-D, Figure 3:figure supplement 1). Ex vivo brain preparations used here for in situ Ca2+ imaging of fpDANs are not viable in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Hence, measurement of store-Ca2+ release and SOCE independent of each other was not possible. Importantly, knockdown of Set2 also abrogated the Ca2+ response to CCh (Figure 3B-D), whereas overexpression of a transgene encoding Set2 in THD' neurons either with loss of SOCE (OraiE180A) or with knockdown of the IP3R (itprRNAi) leads to significant rescue of the Ca2+ response, indicating that Set2 is required downstream of SOCE (Figure 3B-D) and IP3/Ca2+ signalling (Figure 3:figure supplement 1).",

        "text": "An understanding of how Set2 might rescue cellular IP3/Ca2+ signalling was obtained in an earlier study where it was demonstrated that Set2 participates in a transcriptional feedback loop to control the expression of key upstream components such as the mAChR and the IP3R in a set of larval glutamatergic neurons. To test whether Set2 acts through a similar transcriptional feedback loop in the current context, THD' DANs were isolated using FACS from appropriate genetic backgrounds and tested for expression of key genes required for IP3/Ca2+ signalling (mAChR and itpr) and SOCE (Stim and Orai). Loss of SOCE upon expression of OraiE180A leads to a significant decrease in the expression of itpr (72% downregulation; Figure 3E) and mAChR (56% downregulation; Figure 3E) in THD' DANs. As expected, Orai expression (Figure 3E) increased twofold presumably due to overexpression of the OraiE180A transgene. Importantly, knockdown of Set2 in THD' neurons also led to downregulation of itpr (43%), mAChR (78%), and Stim (61%) (Figure 3E). Overexpression of Set2 in the background of OraiE180A led to a rescue in the levels of itpr (69% increase), mAChR (43% increase), and Stim (40% increase) (Figure 3E). Overexpression of Set2 in wildtype THD' neurons resulted in upregulation of mAChR and Orai (Figure 3E). These findings indicate that while SOCE regulates Set2 expression (Figure 2C), Set2 in turn functions in a feedback loop to regulate expression of key components of IP3/Ca2+ (mAchR and IP3R) and SOCE (STIM and Orai) (Figure 3E). Thus, ectopic Set2 overexpression in SOCE-deficient THD' neurons leads to increase in expression of key genes that facilitate intracellular Ca2+ signalling and SOCE (schematised in Figure 3F). Direct measures of Orai-channel function under conditions of altered Set2 expression are needed in future to assess how the feedback loop alters CCh-induced ER-Ca2+ release and SOCE independent of each other (see 'Limitations of this study'). While we assume that the observed changes in gene expression translate to alterations in protein levels, direct measurement of protein levels specifically from THD' neurons needs to be addressed in the future.",

Inhibition of THD' DANs from 72 to 96 hr APF using acute induction of the inward-rectifying K+ channel Kir2.1 or optogenetic inhibition through the hyperpolarising Cl- channel GtACR2 resulted in significant flight deficits (Figure 7A, data in dark or light green). Similar flight defects were recapitulated upon hyperactivation of THD' neurons through either optogenetic (CsChrimson) or thermogenetic (TrpA1) stimulation (Figure 7A, data in orange or red), indicating that these neurons require balanced neuronal activity during a critical window in late pupal development, failing which the flight circuit malfunctions. To test whether restoring excitability in fpDANs lacking SOCE (THD'>OraiEE180A) is sufficient to restore flight, we induced hyperexcitability by overexpressing NachBac, a bacterial Na+ channel. NachBac expression rescued both flight (THD'>OraiEE180A; Figure 7B) and excitability (Figure 7C-E). A partial rescue of flight was also obtained by optogenetic stimulation of neuronal activity through activation of THD'>OraiEE180A DANs using CsChrimson either 72-79 hr APF or 0-2 d post eclosion (Figure 7E). In this case, flight rescues were accompanied by a corresponding rescue of CsChrimson activation-induced Ca2+ entry (Figure 7F and G). Moreover, inducing neuronal hyperactivation with indirect methods such as excess K+ supplementation (Figure 7:figure supplement 1) or impeding glial K+ uptake, by genetic depletion of the glial K+ channel sandman (; Figure 7:figure supplement 2), partially rescued flight in animals lacking SOCE in the THD' DANs. Together, these results indicate that SOCE, through Trl and Set2 activity, determines activity in fpDAN during circuit maturation by regulating expression of voltage-gated ion channel genes, like cac (see 'Discussion').",

        "text": "Neurons undergo maturation of their electrical properties with a gradual increase in depolarising responses and synaptic transmission over the course of pupal development. Here, we show that a subset of DANs require a balance of ion channels for optimal excitation and inhibition essential for adult function. Neuromodulatory signals, such as acetylcholine, are essential for acquiring this balance and act via an SOCE-Trl-Set2 mechanism during late pupal and early adult stages. The ability of Set2 overexpression to rescue SOCE-deficient phenotypes (Figure 6A-C) indicates that anomalous gene expression is the underlying basis of this phenotype. Indeed, SOCE-deficient DANs show reduced expression of an ensemble of voltage-gated ion channel genes (Figure 5E and F), including genes encoding the outward-rectifying K+ channel shaw, slow-inactivating voltage-gated K+ channel shaker, and a Ca2+-gated K+ channel slowpoke and cacophony, a subunit of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (Figure 6G). Ion channels like Shaker and slowpoke play an important role in establishing resting membrane potential, neuronal repolarisation, and mediating afterhyperpolarisation (AHP) after repeated bouts of activity. Though DANs require Set2-mediated expression of cacophony for excitability, cacophony is in itself insufficient to rescue the loss in excitability and flight deficits upon loss of SOCE (Figure 6J). Future experiments that directly visualise electrophysiological responses of fpDANs from different genotypes would help resolve the role of Cac and other ion channels and determine their individual contributions to THD' neuronal activity and excitability. Both flight and KCl depolarisation in SOCE-deficient neurons could, however, be rescued by expression of a heterologous depolarisation-activated Na+ channel NachBac (; Figure 7B-D), which increases neuronal excitability by stimulating a low-threshold positive feedback loop and to a lesser extent by CsChrimson-mediated optogenetic induction of neuronal activity (Figure 7E). The poorer rescue by optogenetic activation may stem from the fact that sustained bursts of activity are non-physiological and can deplete the readily releasable pool of neurotransmitters. Other indirect forms of inducing neuronal hyperactivation (Figure 7:figure supplement 1) in SOCE-deficient neurons also achieved minor rescues in flight. These results identify SOCE as a key driver downstream of developmentally salient neuromodulatory signals for expression of an ion channels suite that enables generation of intrinsic electrical properties and functional maturation of the PPL1 DANs and the flight circuit.",

In this study, we were unable to perform similar SOCE measurements from the fpDANs because they consist of 16-19 neurons in each hemisphere (PPL1 are 10-12 and PPM3 are 6-7 cells) and identifying these few neurons was not technically feasible in culture. Measuring SOCE from these neurons in vivo was not possible due to the presence of abundant extracellular Ca2+ in the brain. Due to these reasons, we have relied upon using CCh to elicit IP3-mediated Ca2+ release and SOCE as a proxy for in vivo SOCE. In previous studies, we have shown that CCh treatment of cultured Drosophila neurons elicits IP3-mediated Ca2+ release and SOCE. Moreover, expression of OraiE180A completely blocks SOCE as measured in primary cultures of DANs and CCh-induced IP3-mediated Ca2+ release is tightly coupled to SOCE in Drosophila neurons. We posit that our measurements of CCh-evoked changes in cellular Ca2+ reflect a composite of IP3-mediated Ca2+ release and SOCE.",

Embedded brains were bathed in AHL and then subjected to functional imaging. The genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP6m was used to record changes in intracellular cytosolic Ca2+ in response to stimulation with CCh or KCl. The GRAB-DA sensor was used to measure evoked dopamine release. Images were taken as a time series on an xy plane at an interval of 1 s using a x20 objective with an NA of 0.7 on an Olympus FV3000 inverted confocal microscope. A 488 nm laser line was used to record GCaMP6m/GRAB-DA measurements. All live-imaging experiments were performed with at least 10 independent brain preparations. For measuring evoked responses, KCl/CCh was added on top of the samples. For optogenetics experiments, flies were reared on medium supplemented with 200 muM all trans retinal (ATR), following which neuronal activation was achieved using a 633 nm laser line to stimulate CsChrimson while simultaneously acquiring images with the 488 nm laser line, and the images were acquired every 1 s. The raw images were extracted using FIJI (; based on ImageJ version 2.1.0/1.53c). DeltaF/F was calculated from selected regions of interest (ROIs) using the formula DeltaF/F = (Ft - F0)/F0, where Ft is the fluorescence at time t and F0 is baseline fluorescence corresponding to the average fluorescence over the first 40 time frames. Mean DeltaF/F time lapses were plotted using PlotTwist (; https://huygens.science.uva.nl/PlotTwist/). A shaded error bar around the mean indicates the 95% confidence interval for CCh (50 microM) or KCl (70 mM) responses. Peaks for individual cellular responses for each genotype were calculated from before or after the point of stimulation using Microsoft Excel and plotted as a paired plot using SuperPlotsOfData (; https://huygens.science.uva.nl/SuperPlotsOfData/). Boxplots were plotted using PlotsOfData (; https://huygens.science.uva.nl/PlotsOfData/).",

        "text": "Immunostaining of larval Drosophila brains was performed as described previously. Briefly, adult brains were dissected in 1x PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The dissected brains were washed 3-4 times with 0.2% phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 containing 0.2% Triton-X 100 (PTX), and blocked with 0.2% PTX containing 5% normal goat serum (NGS) for 2 hr at room temperature. Respective primary antibodies were incubated overnight (14-16 hr) at 4 C. After washing 3-4 times with 0.2% PTX at room temperature, they were incubated in the respective secondary antibodies for 2 hr at room temperature. The following primary antibodies were used: chick anti-GFP antibody (1:10,000; A6455, Life Technologies), mouse anti-nc82 (anti-brp) antibody (1:50), rabbit anti-H3K36me3, and mouse anti-RFP. Secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:400 as follows: anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (#A11008, Life Technologies) and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (#A11001, Life Technologies). Confocal images were obtained on the Olympus Confocal FV1000 microscope (Olympus) with a x40, 1.3 NA objective or with a x60, 1.4 NA objective. Imaging for axonal arbors within the MB gamma lobe was performed on the Zeiss LSM980 system with AiryScan 2. Images were visualised using either the FV10-ASW 4.0 viewer (Olympus) or FIJI. Details for all reagents used are listed in Table S1b.",

The homogenate (10-15 mul) was run on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The protein was transferred to a PVDF membrane by standard semi-dry transfer protocols (10 V for 10 min). The membrane was incubated in the primary antibody overnight at 4 C. Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: rabbit anti-H3K36me3 (1:5000, Abcam, ab9050) and rabbit anti-H3 (1:5000, Abcam, ab12079). Secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were used at dilution of 1:3000 (anti-rabbit HRP; 32260, Thermo Scientific). Protein was detected by a chemiluminescent reaction (WesternBright ECL, Advansta K12045-20). Blots were first probed for H3K36me3, stripped with a solution of 3% glacial acetic acid for 10 min, followed by re-probing with the anti-H3 antibody.",
