In support of this idea, either expression of OraiE180A or knockdown of the IP3R attenuated the composite ER-Ca2+ release plus SOCE response to carbachol (CCh), a mAChR agonist, in PPL1 DANs (Figure 3B-D, Figure 3:figure supplement 1).

To test whether Set2 acts through a similar transcriptional feedback loop in the current context, THD' DANs were isolated using FACS from appropriate genetic backgrounds and tested for expression of key genes required for IP3/Ca2+ signalling (mAChR and itpr) and SOCE (Stim and Orai).

Thus, ectopic Set2 overexpression in SOCE-deficient THD' neurons leads to increase in expression of key genes that facilitate intracellular Ca2+ signalling and SOCE (schematised in Figure 3F). Direct measures of Orai-channel function under conditions of altered Set2 expression are needed in future to assess how the feedback loop alters CCh-induced ER-Ca2+ release and SOCE independent of each other (see 'Limitations of this study').

Inhibition of THD' DANs from 72 to 96 hr APF using acute induction of the inward-rectifying K+ channel Kir2.1 or optogenetic inhibition through the hyperpolarising Cl- channel GtACR2 resulted in significant flight deficits (Figure 7A, data in dark or light green). Similar flight defects were recapitulated upon hyperactivation of THD' neurons through either optogenetic (CsChrimson) or thermogenetic (TrpA1) stimulation (Figure 7A, data in orange or red), indicating that these neurons require balanced neuronal activity during a critical window in late pupal development, failing which the flight circuit malfunctions. To test whether restoring excitability in fpDANs lacking SOCE (THD'>OraiEE180A) is sufficient to restore flight, we induced hyperexcitability by overexpressing NachBac, a bacterial Na+ channel. NachBac expression rescued both flight (THD'>OraiEE180A; Figure 7B) and excitability (Figure 7C-E). A partial rescue of flight was also obtained by optogenetic stimulation of neuronal activity through activation of THD'>OraiEE180A DANs using CsChrimson either 72-79 hr APF or 0-2 d post eclosion (Figure 7E). In this case, flight rescues were accompanied by a corresponding rescue of CsChrimson activation-induced Ca2+ entry (Figure 7F and G). Moreover, inducing neuronal hyperactivation with indirect methods such as excess K+ supplementation (Figure 7:figure supplement 1) or impeding glial K+ uptake, by genetic depletion of the glial K+ channel sandman (; Figure 7:figure supplement 2), partially rescued flight in animals lacking SOCE in the THD' DANs. Together, these results indicate that SOCE, through Trl and Set2 activity, determines activity in fpDAN during circuit maturation by regulating expression of voltage-gated ion channel genes, like cac (see 'Discussion').",

The ability of Set2 overexpression to rescue SOCE-deficient phenotypes (Figure 6A-C) indicates that anomalous gene expression is the underlying basis of this phenotype. Indeed, SOCE-deficient DANs show reduced expression of an ensemble of voltage-gated ion channel genes (Figure 5E and F), including genes encoding the outward-rectifying K+ channel shaw, slow-inactivating voltage-gated K+ channel shaker, and a Ca2+-gated K+ channel slowpoke and cacophony, a subunit of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (Figure 6G). Ion channels like Shaker and slowpoke play an important role in establishing resting membrane potential, neuronal repolarisation, and mediating afterhyperpolarisation (AHP) after repeated bouts of activity. Though DANs require Set2-mediated expression of cacophony for excitability, cacophony is in itself insufficient to rescue the loss in excitability and flight deficits upon loss of SOCE (Figure 6J). Future experiments that directly visualise electrophysiological responses of fpDANs from different genotypes would help resolve the role of Cac and other ion channels and determine their individual contributions to THD' neuronal activity and excitability. Both flight and KCl depolarisation in SOCE-deficient neurons could, however, be rescued by expression of a heterologous depolarisation-activated Na+ channel NachBac (; Figure 7B-D), which increases neuronal excitability by stimulating a low-threshold positive feedback loop and to a lesser extent by CsChrimson-mediated optogenetic induction of neuronal activity (Figure 7E). The poorer rescue by optogenetic activation may stem from the fact that sustained bursts of activity are non-physiological and can deplete the readily releasable pool of neurotransmitters. Other indirect forms of inducing neuronal hyperactivation (Figure 7:figure supplement 1) in SOCE-deficient neurons also achieved minor rescues in flight.

Here, we show that a subset of DANs require a balance of ion channels for optimal excitation and inhibition essential for adult function. Neuromodulatory signals, such as acetylcholine, are essential for acquiring this balance and act via an SOCE-Trl-Set2 mechanism during late pupal and early adult stages. The ability of Set2 overexpression to rescue SOCE-deficient phenotypes (Figure 6A-C) indicates that anomalous gene expression is the underlying basis of this phenotype. Indeed, SOCE-deficient DANs show reduced expression of an ensemble of voltage-gated ion channel genes (Figure 5E and F), including genes encoding the outward-rectifying K+ channel shaw, slow-inactivating voltage-gated K+ channel shaker, and a Ca2+-gated K+ channel slowpoke and cacophony, a subunit of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (Figure 6G). Ion channels like Shaker and slowpoke play an important role in establishing resting membrane potential, neuronal repolarisation, and mediating afterhyperpolarisation (AHP) after repeated bouts of activity. Though DANs require Set2-mediated expression of cacophony for excitability, cacophony is in itself insufficient to rescue the loss in excitability and flight deficits upon loss of SOCE (Figure 6J). Future experiments that directly visualise electrophysiological responses of fpDANs from different genotypes would help resolve the role of Cac and other ion channels and determine their individual contributions to THD' neuronal activity and excitability. Both flight and KCl depolarisation in SOCE-deficient neurons could, however, be rescued by expression of a heterologous depolarisation-activated Na+ channel NachBac (; Figure 7B-D), which increases neuronal excitability by stimulating a low-threshold positive feedback loop and to a lesser extent by CsChrimson-mediated optogenetic induction of neuronal activity (Figure 7E). The poorer rescue by optogenetic activation may stem from the fact that sustained bursts of activity are non-physiological and can deplete the readily releasable pool of neurotransmitters. Other indirect forms of inducing neuronal hyperactivation (Figure 7:figure supplement 1) in SOCE-deficient neurons also achieved minor rescues in flight. These results identify SOCE as a key driver downstream of developmentally salient neuromodulatory signals for expression of an ion channels suite that enables generation of intrinsic electrical properties and functional maturation of the PPL1 DANs and the flight circuit.",

Here, we show that a subset of DANs require a balance of ion channels for optimal excitation and inhibition essential for adult function. Neuromodulatory signals, such as acetylcholine, are essential for acquiring this balance and act via an SOCE-Trl-Set2 mechanism during late pupal and early adult stages. The ability of Set2 overexpression to rescue SOCE-deficient phenotypes (Figure 6A-C) indicates that anomalous gene expression is the underlying basis of this phenotype. Indeed, SOCE-deficient DANs show reduced expression of an ensemble of voltage-gated ion channel genes (Figure 5E and F), including genes encoding the outward-rectifying K+ channel shaw, slow-inactivating voltage-gated K+ channel shaker, and a Ca2+-gated K+ channel slowpoke and cacophony, a subunit of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (Figure 6G). Ion channels like Shaker and slowpoke play an important role in establishing resting membrane potential, neuronal repolarisation, and mediating afterhyperpolarisation (AHP) after repeated bouts of activity. Though DANs require Set2-mediated expression of cacophony for excitability, cacophony is in itself insufficient to rescue the loss in excitability and flight deficits upon loss of SOCE (Figure 6J). Future experiments that directly visualise electrophysiological responses of fpDANs from different genotypes would help resolve the role of Cac and other ion channels and determine their individual contributions to THD' neuronal activity and excitability. Both flight and KCl depolarisation in SOCE-deficient neurons could, however, be rescued by expression of a heterologous depolarisation-activated Na+ channel NachBac (; Figure 7B-D), which increases neuronal excitability by stimulating a low-threshold positive feedback loop and to a lesser extent by CsChrimson-mediated optogenetic induction of neuronal activity (Figure 7E). The poorer rescue by optogenetic activation may stem from the fact that sustained bursts of activity are non-physiological and can deplete the readily releasable pool of neurotransmitters. Other indirect forms of inducing neuronal hyperactivation (Figure 7:figure supplement 1) in SOCE-deficient neurons also achieved minor rescues in flight. These results identify SOCE as a key driver downstream of developmentally salient neuromodulatory signals for expression of an ion channels suite that enables generation of intrinsic electrical properties and functional maturation of the PPL1 DANs and the flight circuit.",

Embedded brains were bathed in AHL and then subjected to functional imaging. The genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP6m was used to record changes in intracellular cytosolic Ca2+ in response to stimulation with CCh or KCl. The GRAB-DA sensor was used to measure evoked dopamine release. Images were taken as a time series on an xy plane at an interval of 1 s using a x20 objective with an NA of 0.7 on an Olympus FV3000 inverted confocal microscope. A 488 nm laser line was used to record GCaMP6m/GRAB-DA measurements. All live-imaging experiments were performed with at least 10 independent brain preparations. For measuring evoked responses, KCl/CCh was added on top of the samples. For optogenetics experiments, flies were reared on medium supplemented with 200 muM all trans retinal (ATR), following which neuronal activation was achieved using a 633 nm laser line to stimulate CsChrimson while simultaneously acquiring images with the 488 nm laser line, and the images were acquired every 1 s. The raw images were extracted using FIJI (; based on ImageJ version 2.1.0/1.53c). DeltaF/F was calculated from selected regions of interest (ROIs) using the formula DeltaF/F = (Ft - F0)/F0, where Ft is the fluorescence at time t and F0 is baseline fluorescence corresponding to the average fluorescence over the first 40 time frames. Mean DeltaF/F time lapses were plotted using PlotTwist (; https://huygens.science.uva.nl/PlotTwist/). A shaded error bar around the mean indicates the 95% confidence interval for CCh (50 microM) or KCl (70 mM) responses.

Loss of SOCE upon expression of OraiE180A leads to a significant decrease in the expression of itpr (72% downregulation; Figure 3E) and mAChR (56% downregulation; Figure 3E) in THD' DANs. As expected, Orai expression (Figure 3E) increased twofold presumably due to overexpression of the OraiE180A transgene. Importantly, knockdown of Set2 in THD' neurons also led to downregulation of itpr (43%), mAChR (78%), and Stim (61%) (Figure 3E). Overexpression of Set2 in the background of OraiE180A led to a rescue in the levels of itpr (69% increase), mAChR (43% increase), and Stim (40% increase) (Figure 3E). Overexpression of Set2 in wildtype THD' neurons resulted in upregulation of mAChR and Orai (Figure 3E). These findings indicate that while SOCE regulates Set2 expression (Figure 2C), Set2 in turn functions in a feedback loop to regulate expression of key components of IP3/Ca2+ (mAchR and IP3R) and SOCE (STIM and Orai) (Figure 3E). Thus, ectopic Set2 overexpression in SOCE-deficient THD' neurons leads to increase in expression of key genes that facilitate intracellular Ca2+ signalling and SOCE (schematised in Figure 3F). Direct measures of Orai-channel function under conditions of altered Set2 expression are needed in future to assess how the feedback loop alters CCh-induced ER-Ca2+ release and SOCE independent of each other (see 'Limitations of this study'). While we assume that the observed changes in gene expression translate to alterations in protein levels, direct measurement of protein levels specifically from THD' neurons needs to be addressed in the future."

The ability of Set2 overexpression to rescue SOCE-deficient phenotypes (Figure 6A-C) indicates that anomalous gene expression is the underlying basis of this phenotype. Indeed, SOCE-deficient DANs show reduced expression of an ensemble of voltage-gated ion channel genes (Figure 5E and F), including genes encoding the outward-rectifying K+ channel shaw, slow-inactivating voltage-gated K+ channel shaker, and a Ca2+-gated K+ channel slowpoke and cacophony, a subunit of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (Figure 6G). Ion channels like Shaker and slowpoke play an important role in establishing resting membrane potential, neuronal repolarisation, and mediating afterhyperpolarisation (AHP) after repeated bouts of activity. Though DANs require Set2-mediated expression of cacophony for excitability, cacophony is in itself insufficient to rescue the loss in excitability and flight deficits upon loss of SOCE (Figure 6J). Future experiments that directly visualise electrophysiological responses of fpDANs from different genotypes would help resolve the role of Cac and other ion channels and determine their individual contributions to THD' neuronal activity and excitability.

Here, we show that a subset of DANs require a balance of ion channels for optimal excitation and inhibition essential for adult function. Neuromodulatory signals, such as acetylcholine, are essential for acquiring this balance and act via an SOCE-Trl-Set2 mechanism during late pupal and early adult stages. The ability of Set2 overexpression to rescue SOCE-deficient phenotypes (Figure 6A-C) indicates that anomalous gene expression is the underlying basis of this phenotype. Indeed, SOCE-deficient DANs show reduced expression of an ensemble of voltage-gated ion channel genes (Figure 5E and F), including genes encoding the outward-rectifying K+ channel shaw, slow-inactivating voltage-gated K+ channel shaker, and a Ca2+-gated K+ channel slowpoke and cacophony, a subunit of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (Figure 6G). Ion channels like Shaker and slowpoke play an important role in establishing resting membrane potential, neuronal repolarisation, and mediating afterhyperpolarisation (AHP) after repeated bouts of activity. Though DANs require Set2-mediated expression of cacophony for excitability, cacophony is in itself insufficient to rescue the loss in excitability and flight deficits upon loss of SOCE (Figure 6J). Future experiments that directly visualise electrophysiological responses of fpDANs from different genotypes would help resolve the role of Cac and other ion channels and determine their individual contributions to THD' neuronal activity and excitability. Both flight and KCl depolarisation in SOCE-deficient neurons could, however, be rescued by expression of a heterologous depolarisation-activated Na+ channel NachBac (; Figure 7B-D), which increases neuronal excitability by stimulating a low-threshold positive feedback loop and to a lesser extent by CsChrimson-mediated optogenetic induction of neuronal activity (Figure 7E). The poorer rescue by optogenetic activation may stem from the fact that sustained bursts of activity are non-physiological and can deplete the readily releasable pool of neurotransmitters. Other indirect forms of inducing neuronal hyperactivation (Figure 7:figure supplement 1) in SOCE-deficient neurons also achieved minor rescues in flight. These results identify SOCE as a key driver downstream of developmentally salient neuromodulatory signals for expression of an ion channels suite that enables generation of intrinsic electrical properties and functional maturation of the PPL1 DANs and the flight circuit."

Indeed, SOCE-deficient DANs show reduced expression of an ensemble of voltage-gated ion channel genes (Figure 5E and F), including genes encoding the outward-rectifying K+ channel shaw, slow-inactivating voltage-gated K+ channel shaker, and a Ca2+-gated K+ channel slowpoke and cacophony, a subunit of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (Figure 6G). Ion channels like Shaker and slowpoke play an important role in establishing resting membrane potential, neuronal repolarisation, and mediating afterhyperpolarisation (AHP) after repeated bouts of activity. Though DANs require Set2-mediated expression of cacophony for excitability, cacophony is in itself insufficient to rescue the loss in excitability and flight deficits upon loss of SOCE (Figure 6J). Future experiments that directly visualise electrophysiological responses of fpDANs from different genotypes would help resolve the role of Cac and other ion channels and determine their individual contributions to THD' neuronal activity and excitability. Both flight and KCl depolarisation in SOCE-deficient neurons could, however, be rescued by expression of a heterologous depolarisation-activated Na+ channel NachBac (; Figure 7B-D), which increases neuronal excitability by stimulating a low-threshold positive feedback loop and to a lesser extent by CsChrimson-mediated optogenetic induction of neuronal activity (Figure 7E). The poorer rescue by optogenetic activation may stem from the fact that sustained bursts of activity are non-physiological and can deplete the readily releasable pool of neurotransmitters. Other indirect forms of inducing neuronal hyperactivation (Figure 7:figure supplement 1) in SOCE-deficient neurons also achieved minor rescues in flight. These results identify SOCE as a key driver downstream of developmentally salient neuromodulatory signals for expression of an ion channels suite that enables generation of intrinsic electrical properties and functional maturation of the PPL1 DANs and the flight circuit."

Future experiments that directly visualise electrophysiological responses of fpDANs from different genotypes would help resolve the role of Cac and other ion channels and determine their individual contributions to THD' neuronal activity and excitability. Both flight and KCl depolarisation in SOCE-deficient neurons could, however, be rescued by expression of a heterologous depolarisation-activated Na+ channel NachBac (; Figure 7B-D), which increases neuronal excitability by stimulating a low-threshold positive feedback loop and to a lesser extent by CsChrimson-mediated optogenetic induction of neuronal activity (Figure 7E). The poorer rescue by optogenetic activation may stem from the fact that sustained bursts of activity are non-physiological and can deplete the readily releasable pool of neurotransmitters. Other indirect forms of inducing neuronal hyperactivation (Figure 7:figure supplement 1) in SOCE-deficient neurons also achieved minor rescues in flight. These results identify SOCE as a key driver downstream of developmentally salient neuromodulatory signals for expression of an ion channels suite that enables generation of intrinsic electrical properties and functional maturation of the PPL1 DANs and the flight circuit."

DeltaF/F was calculated from selected regions of interest (ROIs) using the formula DeltaF/F = (Ft - F0)/F0, where Ft is the fluorescence at time t and F0 is baseline fluorescence corresponding to the average fluorescence over the first 40 time frames. Mean DeltaF/F time lapses were plotted using PlotTwist (; https://huygens.science.uva.nl/PlotTwist/). A shaded error bar around the mean indicates the 95% confidence interval for CCh (50 microM) or KCl (70 mM) responses. Peaks for individual cellular responses for each genotype were calculated from before or after the point of stimulation using Microsoft Excel and plotted as a paired plot using SuperPlotsOfData (; https://huygens.science.uva.nl/SuperPlotsOfData/). Boxplots were plotted using PlotsOfData (; https://huygens.science.uva.nl/PlotsOfData/)."
