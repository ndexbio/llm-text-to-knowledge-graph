            "text": "Therapies that target the EGF receptor (EGFR), such as gefitinib (IRESSA), are effective in a subset of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The differences in intracellular signaling networks between gefitinib-sensitive and -resistant NSCLCs remain poorly understood. In this study, we observe that gefitinib reduces phospho-Akt levels only in NSCLC cell lines in which it inhibits growth. To elucidate the mechanism underlying this observation, we compared immunoprecipitates of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) between gefitinib-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cell lines. We observe that PI3K associates with ErbB-3 exclusively in gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell lines. Gefitinib dissociates this complex, thereby linking EGFR inhibition to decreased Akt activity. In contrast, gefitinib-resistant cells do not use ErbB-3 to activate the PI3K-Akt pathway. In fact, abundant ErbB-3 expression is detected only in gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell lines. Two gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell lines with endogenous distinct activating EGFR mutations (L858R and Del747-749), frequently observed in NSCLC patients who respond to gefitinib, also use ErbB-3 to couple to PI3K. Down-regulation of ErbB-3 by means of short hairpin RNA leads to decreased phospho-Akt levels in the gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell lines, Calu-3 (WT EGFR) and H3255 (L858R EGFR), but has no effect on Akt activation in the gefitinib-resistant cell lines, A549 and H522. We conclude that ErbB-3 is used to couple EGFR to the PI3K-Akt pathway in gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell lines harboring WT and mutant EGFRs.",

These receptors homodimerize or heterodimerize upon ligand binding. Upon dimerization, there is transautophosphorylation of the dimer partner. The tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins then serve as docking molecules to initiate intracellular signaling pathways. ErbB-3 is unique among the ErbB family members in that it has been shown to have weak or no tyrosine kinase activity. However, it is believed to couple with other ErbB family members to activate intracellular signaling. In particular, ErbB-3 effectively couples to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway. It has six tyrosine phosphorylation sites with YXXMs motifs that serve as excellent binding sites for PI3K.",

Patients treated with gefitinib have a response rate of 10\u201320%, whereas another 20\u201330% of patients have stable disease for at least 2 months. Recent studies indicate that a majority of patients who respond to EGFR-TKI therapy contain somatic mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain that include EGFR L858R and EGFR with deletions in exon 19. The mechanisms by which these mutations promote a cancer phenotype are incompletely defined. Experiments assessing overexpression of the EGFR mutants in fibroblasts and mammary epithelial cells suggest that the EGFR mutants may display different kinetics of activation and deactivation, as well as differential patterns of autophosphorylation and intracellular signaling cascades. Presumably, these mutations provide persistent stimulation of downstream pathways that drive cell transformation.",

Initial investigations revealed that multiple NSCLC cell lines tested (10) are growth-inhibited by 50% in the presence of 20 \u03bcM LY294002, a potent PI3K inhibitor. Thus, we hypothesized that gefitinib may inhibit the PI3K-Akt pathway only in NSCLC cell lines in which it inhibits growth. As demonstrated, H1299, A549, and H23 cells all have an IC50 > 1 \u03bcM (\u2018\u2018gefitinib-resistant\u2019\u2019), whereas Calu-3, H358, and A431 cells all have an IC50 < 1 \u03bcM (\u2018\u2018gefitinib-sensitive\u2019\u2019). As shown, gefitinib leads to a reduction in phospho-Akt only in the gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell lines. The gefitinib concentration of 1 \u03bcM was used as the cutoff for sensitivity because this concentration approaches levels observed in serum from patients under treatment and has been used in other studies to distinguish between sensitive and resistant cell lines. Sequencing of the EGFR and K-Ras genes in these cell lines reveals that the EGFR in these cell lines does not have any mutations that are observed in a subset of NSCLC patients responding to gefitinib. The A431 cell line is an epidermoid carcinoma that is known to have amplification of the EGFR and is commonly used in studies assessing anti-EGFR therapy.",

To help determine the identity of this PTyr protein, the SCANSITE matrix was used to search for proteins in the SWISS-PROT database of the molecular mass range 140\u2013200 kDa that contain potential p85 SH2 binding sites. Six of the top 15 hits in this molecular weight range were from the same protein, ErbB-3. Therefore, the p85 IPs were probed with anti-ErbB-3 antibodies. In the gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell lines, there is indeed a gefitinib-labile interaction between p85 and ErbB-3. The ErbB-3 band comigrates with the PTyr band of 210 kDa.

Previous studies have shown that breast cancer cell lines with overexpression of ErbB-2 are sensitive to gefitinib. The studies we have presented thus far demonstrate that Calu-3 cellular growth and Akt activation are inhibited by 1 \u03bcM gefitinib but do not demonstrate whether these effects are due to inhibition of EGFR or off-target inhibition of ErbB-2. We performed a dose-response analysis of the p85\u2013ErbB-3 interaction as well as the phosphorylation status of Akt, EGFR, ErbB-2, and ErbB-3. As shown, phosphorylated Akt levels are dramatically reduced by 0.25 \u03bcM gefitinib. At this concentration, we also observe a reduction in the amount of ErbB-3 associated with p85 and decreased levels of phosphorylated ErbB-3 and phosphorylated EGFR. In contrast, phosphorylated ErbB-2 levels are not significantly reduced until concentrations of 4 \u03bcM are used. Of note, previous reports showed that the IC50 for inhibition of ErbB-2 by gefitinib is 100-fold higher than that for EGFR in vitro and that an exogenously expressed chimeric protein containing the ErbB-2 intracellular domain is not significantly inhibited by 1 \u03bcM gefitinib. Thus, although our experiments do not clearly demonstrate that gefitinib\u2019s effects on PI3K activation are due to inhibition of EGFR and not ErbB-2, this explanation seems more plausible given this collection of observations.",

The experiments presented thus far have evaluated NSCLC cell lines with WT EGFR. However, it appears that the majority of cancers with dramatic responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition harbor a somatic mutation in the EGFR. Therefore, we evaluated two patient-derived NSCLC cell lines that have mutant EGFR: H3255 and DFCILU-011 cells. H3255 cells contain an EGFR with a point mutation (L858R) and DFCILU-011 contains a deletion mutation in exon 19 (Del747-749). Both cell lines are very sensitive to gefitinib, with an IC50 of 50 nM. As shown, Akt activity is diminished in both cell lines when they are grown in full serum in the presence of gefitinib. Interestingly, we observe an interaction between p85 and ErbB-3 that is disrupted by gefitinib in both cell lines, suggesting that the mutant EGFRs activate the PI3K-Akt pathway by means of ErbB-3 as well. In the H3255 cells, PI3K also associates with an 110-kDa PTyr protein in a gefitinib-sensitive manner. Indeed, both the DFCILU-011 and H3255 cells demonstrate significant expression of ErbB-3, analogous to the gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell lines with WT EGFR. These results suggest that the mutant EGFRs also use ErbB-3 for activation of PI3K.",

The data generated in this study suggest that ErbB-3 is used to activate the PI3K-Akt pathway in gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell lines, whether the EGFR is WT or mutant. To test this idea, we interfered with ErbB-3 expression by employing RNA interference using a lentiviral-based shRNA expression system. The Calu-3 and H3255 cells were infected with ErbB-3 shRNA and control virus. For controls, the cell lines A549 and H522, which do not express ErbB-3, were also infected with the same viruses. As shown, the ErbB-3 shRNA efficiently down-regulated ErbB-3 in both the Calu-3 and H3255 cells, leading to a marked reduction in phospho-Akt levels and demonstrating that ErbB-3 couples to the PI3K-Akt pathway in these cells. In contrast, the amount of phospho-Akt was unchanged in the A549 and H522 cell lines infected with ErbB-3 shRNA. As shown, there is no appreciable expression of ErbB-3 detected in A549 or H522 cells.",

            "text": "It has been known for almost a decade that ErbB-3 is a very potent link between EGFR activation and PI3K activity. However, the role of ErbB-3 in tumorigenesis is currently evolving. For example, in a subclone of NIH 3T3 cells that does not express endogenous ErbB receptors, EGFR expression alone is unable to promote cellular transformation. However, coexpression with ErbB-3 coupled with stimulation with heregulin (not EGF) was sufficient to induce cellular transformation. It also appears that ErbB-3 likely promotes ErbB-2-HER2-dependant breast carcinogenesis; down-regulation of ErbB-3 leads to G1 arrest and decreased Akt phosphorylation in SKBR3 cells. Those observations, together with the ones in this study, suggest that cancer cell lines driven by a member of the ErbB receptor system often couple to ErbB-3 to activate the PI3K-Akt pathway and promote the cancer phenotype. Thus, antibodies that inhibit ErbB-3\u2019s heterodimerization with other ErbB family members may serve as a therapeutic strategy for cancers driven by either EGFR or ErbB-2.",

The data in the present study are in agreement with a recently published report evaluating gefitinib sensitivity in multiple NSCLC cell lines. Although not explicitly stated by the authors of that study, the three NSCLC cell lines most sensitive to gefitinib (H358, PC9, and A431 cells) in that study appear to be the ones with the highest expression of ErbB-3. It is unlikely that all NSCLC (and NSCLC cell lines) that express ErbB-3 will respond to anti-EGFR therapy. However, the data presented in this study suggest that cancers responding to anti-EGFR therapy will likely have significant ErbB-3 expression. Therefore, assessment of ErbB-3 expression in NSCLC specimens may prove useful to enrich for the population of patients most likely to receive clinical benefit from anti-EGFR therapy. If such a correlation is observed, a clinical trial assessing ErbB-3 expression status to determine who should receive anti-EGFR therapy as first-line treatment may be warranted.",
