The differences in intracellular signaling networks between gefitinib-sensitive and -resistant NSCLCs remain poorly understood. In this study, we observe that gefitinib reduces phospho-Akt levels only in NSCLC cell lines in which it inhibits growth. To elucidate the mechanism underlying this observation, we compared immunoprecipitates of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) between gefitinib-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cell lines. We observe that PI3K associates with ErbB-3 exclusively in gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell lines. Gefitinib dissociates this complex, thereby linking EGFR inhibition to decreased Akt activity. In contrast, gefitinib-resistant cells do not use ErbB-3 to activate the PI3K-Akt pathway. In fact, abundant ErbB-3 expression is detected only in gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell lines. Two gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell lines with endogenous distinct activating EGFR mutations (L858R and Del747-749), frequently observed in NSCLC patients who respond to gefitinib, also use ErbB-3 to couple to PI3K. Down-regulation of ErbB-3 by means of short hairpin RNA leads to decreased phospho-Akt levels in the gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell lines, Calu-3 (WT EGFR) and H3255 (L858R EGFR), but has no effect on Akt activation in the gefitinib-resistant cell lines, A549 and H522. We conclude that ErbB-3 is used to couple EGFR to the PI3K-Akt pathway in gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell lines harboring WT and mutant EGFRs.",

Patients treated with gefitinib have a response rate of 10\u201320%, whereas another 20\u201330% of patients have stable disease for at least 2 months. Recent studies indicate that a majority of patients who respond to EGFR-TKI therapy contain somatic mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain that include EGFR L858R and EGFR with deletions in exon 19. The mechanisms by which these mutations promote a cancer phenotype are incompletely defined. Experiments assessing overexpression of the EGFR mutants in fibroblasts and mammary epithelial cells suggest that the EGFR mutants may display different kinetics of activation and deactivation, as well as differential patterns of autophosphorylation and intracellular signaling cascades.
