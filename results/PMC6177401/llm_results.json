There are four serotypes of the virus. Each serotype is antigenically different, meaning they elicit heterologous antibodies. Infection with one serotype will create neutralizing antibodies to the serotype. Cross-protection from other serotypes is not long term, instead heterotypic infection can cause severe disease. This review will focus on the innate immune response to DENV infection and the virus evasion of the innate immune system by escaping recognition or inhibiting the production of an antiviral state. Activated innate immune pathways includes type I interferon, complement, apoptosis, and autophagy, which the virus can evade or exploit to exacerbate disease. It is important to understand out how the immune system reacts to infection and how the virus evades immune response in order to develop effective antivirals and vaccines.",

It is transmitted mainly by the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Over half of the global population is at risk for dengue infection, with 100 million symptomatic cases being reported every year. There are four genetically distinct serotypes of the virus, DENV1-4. Due to the antigenic differences between the serotypes, infection with one serotype will confer long-lasting immune protection against that serotype only, while cross-protection against other serotypes are short term.

Secondary infections, however, are known to cause severe disease, specifically after a heterotypic infection. The exact cause of this is unknown, but the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) may cause increased pathogenicity and virulence. ADE occurs when antibodies from a previous heterotypic infection do not neutralize a secondary infection with a different subtype but still bind to viral proteins. This creates a virus-antibody complex phagocytosed by cells that are not usually infected via Fcgamma receptors, specifically monocytes via FcgammaIIa receptor. This results in increased viremia and pathology. Severe disease is seen in only 1% of DENV cases; however, mortality in severe cases can have a rate of up to 20%",

DENV RNA translation and replication occur at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (4). The host ribosome directly translates the genomic RNA into a polyprotein, where host and viral proteases cleave the nascent protein into structural (blue) and nonstructural (red) proteins (5). RNA replication occurs in virus-induced membrane vesicles by the viral replication complex, with the transmembrane NS2a, NS2b, NS4a, and NS4b proteins acting as the scaffold (6). The viral genome is packaged into the immature virus particles during assembly (7). These particles are transported through the Golgi apparatus, where host furin-like proteases cleave the prM peptide (8), and the nascent viral particles exit the cell via exocytosis as fully mature virions (9). Some pr peptides are not cleaved resulting in immature, non-infectious virions or partially mature virions. The soluble NS1 hexamer is also secreted",

The NS1 dimer is located on the lumen side of the ER, yet it plays an essential role in viral RNA replication, since deletion of NS1 from the viral genome inhibits replication. Through transmembrane interaction with NS4a and NS4b, NS1 will help form vesicles for virus replication, called the viral replication complex (RC), and colocalize with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (Fig. 1). It also modulates infectious virus particle production by interacting with structural proteins prM/E. NS4a plays a role in membrane alteration, in order to form the RC. NS2a is crucial for viral RNA synthesis and virion assembly. NS2b binds to NS3 and forms the functional NS3 protease. NS4b interacts with the NS3 helicase domain.",

During viral infection of mammalian hosts, viral RNA is recognized by the miRNA-RISC assembly and targeted for silencing or degradation (Fig. 2). Knockdown of essential components of RNAi (Dicer, Drosha, Argo1, Argo2) resulted increased DENV viral titer in human cell line Huh7, implicating RNAi as a regulator of DENV replication.

Double membrane vacuoles, called autophagosomes, will engulf cytoplasmic material and fuse with the lysosome for degradation. Thus, autophagy is an important system to clearing the host of foreign pathogens such as viruses. Autophagy has been shown to be activated in DENV infections and has antiviral or pro-viral activity depending on cell type. Autophagy inhibits replication in monocytes, specifically under ADE conditions, which make these cells highly susceptible to infection. Reticulophagy, a selective autophagy process for ER homeostasis, reduces DENV via its FAM134B receptor in endothelial cells. In liver cells, autophagy has a pro-viral effect. DENV blocks the autophagosome from fusing with the lysosome, and instead uses the vacuoles for replication, assembly and maturation, and evading neutralizing antibodies during transmission.",

DENV can block PRR signaling and production of type I IFN response by targeting the RLR and TLR pathways mentioned above. NS5 2'-O-methylation of 5' prevents the virus from being sensed by RIG-I. NS3 blocks RIG-I translocation to mitochondria by binding with the mitochondrial-targeting chaperone protein 14-3-3epsilon. NS4a will also inhibit RIG-I interaction with MAVS by binding to the MAVS CARD-like domain and transmembrane domain. NS2a and NS4b from DENV1, 2, 4, and NS4a from DENV1 block the RIG-I/MAVS signaling pathway by preventing phosphorylation of TBK1/IRF, inhibiting IFNbeta induction. NS2b targets cGAS for autophagy-lysosome-dependent degradation and prevents mitochondrial DNA sensing. NS2b/3 protease inhibits IFN production by cleaving STING (Fig. 4). NS4b triggers elongation of mitochondria by inactivating mitochondrial fission factor dynamin-related protein 1, resulting in altered mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), increased DENV replication, and decreased IFN production:possibly by blocking activated RIG-I recruitment to MAMs.",
