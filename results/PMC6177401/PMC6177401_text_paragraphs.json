There are four serotypes of the virus. Each serotype is antigenically different, meaning they elicit heterologous antibodies. Infection with one serotype will create neutralizing antibodies to the serotype. Cross-protection from other serotypes is not long term, instead heterotypic infection can cause severe disease. This review will focus on the innate immune response to DENV infection and the virus evasion of the innate immune system by escaping recognition or inhibiting the production of an antiviral state. Activated innate immune pathways includes type I interferon, complement, apoptosis, and autophagy, which the virus can evade or exploit to exacerbate disease. It is important to understand out how the immune system reacts to infection and how the virus evades immune response in order to develop effective antivirals and vaccines.",

Secondary infections, however, are known to cause severe disease, specifically after a heterotypic infection. The exact cause of this is unknown, but the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) may cause increased pathogenicity and virulence. ADE occurs when antibodies from a previous heterotypic infection do not neutralize a secondary infection with a different subtype but still bind to viral proteins. This creates a virus-antibody complex phagocytosed by cells that are not usually infected via Fcgamma receptors, specifically monocytes via FcgammaIIa receptor. This results in increased viremia and pathology. Severe disease is seen in only 1% of DENV cases; however, mortality in severe cases can have a rate of up to 20%",

The NS1 dimer is located on the lumen side of the ER, yet it plays an essential role in viral RNA replication, since deletion of NS1 from the viral genome inhibits replication. Through transmembrane interaction with NS4a and NS4b, NS1 will help form vesicles for virus replication, called the viral replication complex (RC), and colocalize with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (Fig. 1). It also modulates infectious virus particle production by interacting with structural proteins prM/E. NS4a plays a role in membrane alteration, in order to form the RC.

RNAi is a sequence-specific process to regulate gene expression mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) or microRNA (miRNA). Dicer will create siRNA from long dsRNA, while both Drosha and Dicer are needed to create miRNA. These small non-coding RNAs will associate with RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) in the cytoplasm to target mRNA for inhibition or degradation by Argonaute (Argo) proteins. During viral infection of mammalian hosts, viral RNA is recognized by the miRNA-RISC assembly and targeted for silencing or degradation (Fig. 2). Knockdown of essential components of RNAi (Dicer, Drosha, Argo1, Argo2) resulted increased DENV viral titer in human cell line Huh7, implicating RNAi as a regulator of DENV replication.

Double membrane vacuoles, called autophagosomes, will engulf cytoplasmic material and fuse with the lysosome for degradation. Thus, autophagy is an important system to clearing the host of foreign pathogens such as viruses. Autophagy has been shown to be activated in DENV infections and has antiviral or pro-viral activity depending on cell type. Autophagy inhibits replication in monocytes, specifically under ADE conditions, which make these cells highly susceptible to infection. Reticulophagy, a selective autophagy process for ER homeostasis, reduces DENV via its FAM134B receptor in endothelial cells. In liver cells, autophagy has a pro-viral effect. DENV blocks the autophagosome from fusing with the lysosome, and instead uses the vacuoles for replication, assembly and maturation, and evading neutralizing antibodies during transmission.",

Minocycline, typically used as an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory, inhibits DENV replication in vitro by suppressing migration inhibitory facto, a catalyst for autophagy, and this drug also decreased viremia and autophagy formation in vivo. AR-12, a derivative of celecoxib (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) that inhibits PI3K/Akt signaling (the pathway that has shown to be activated by DENV2 to block apoptosis), reduces viral replication in all four serotypes in vitro and protects against DEV2 in vivo. Schisandrin A, a derivative of the herbal medicinal plant Schisandra chinesis, inhibited DENV replication and increased type I IFN response in vitro and in vivo. Secreted phospholipase A2, obtained from snake venom showed viricidal, has neutralizing activity against DENV, targeting the virus envelope lipid bilayer.",

        "text": "DENV is a mosquito-borne Flavivirus that is endemic in many tropical and sub-tropical countries. The NS proteins are responsible for viral replication and host innate immune evasion. The innate immune response to DENV is not well characterized nor are the exact roles of the NS proteins in evading the immune response. The main innate immune response is type I IFN and the main evasion mechanism of the virus is to target against the type I IFN response. Other innate immune responses include complement activation, apoptosis, autophagy, and RNAi. It is important to understand the host innate immune response to infection and how the virus evades or exploits this in order to develop effective antivirals and vaccines.",
