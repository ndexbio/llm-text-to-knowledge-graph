In order to determine whether cyclin D1 rescue of cyclin D1-/- cells augmented cell-cycle progression during this time frame, we compared the cyclin D1-/- and cyclin D1-/-cyclin D1WT rescued cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis demonstrated trivial differences in cell-cycle distribution in the 0- to 4-h time frame, with an augmentation of S phase enrichment (9.9 versus 13.5) occurring at 24 h (Figure S9A). CDK inhibitors have been shown to reduce the RB kinase function of the cyclin D1/CDK4 complex; however, significant additional interactions have been identified (reviewed in), warranting an analysis of CDK inhibitor impact on Akt1 phosphorylation at Ser473 and the interaction with Rictor. To this end, we deployed MEFs encoding tamoxifen-inducible Rictor small interfering RNA (siRNA). Acute reduction in Rictor abundance reduced Akt1 Ser473 compared with Akt1 (Figure S9B, lane 1 versus lane 4). The addition of the two distinct CDK inhibitors palbociclib (8 mum) or abemociclib (8 mum) reduced RB phosphorylation at Ser780 without significant effects on the relative phosphorylation of Akt1 Ser473 (Figure S9B, lanes 1 versus lanes 2 and 3). The reduction on RB phosphorylation by acute siRictor may be due to the previously described reduction in cyclin D1. In contrast, after chronic reduction in Rictor (30 days), the addition of a CDK inhibitor:abemaciclib (4-8 mum) or palbociclib (4-8 mum):reduced Akt1 Ser473 abundance compared with that of Akt1 (Figure S9C, lane 1 versus lane 5). Together, these studies are consistent with the known importance of Rictor to induce Akt1 Ser473 phosphorylation, and the new evidence herein that endogenous cyclin D/CDK4/6 activity augments Akt1 Ser473 phosphorylation, in part dependent upon the relative activity of Rictor in the cells."

Cyclin D1 restored Akt1 signaling in a kinase-dependent manner, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of Akt1 and its substrates, shown by western blot, immunofluorescence, and IHC in tissue culture and in transgenic mice. Using cyclin D1-/- cells for reconstitution, we demonstrated that cyclin D1 is sufficient to augment Akt1 signaling, as demonstrated by phosphorylation of Akt1 (Ser473) and downstream substrates of Akt1 (TSC2 Ser939, FOXO1 Ser319, and Bad Ser126). The phosphorylation of Akt1 Ser473 by cyclin D1-associated kinase was observed upon acute cyclin D1 overexpression in mammary epithelium of tissue-specific inducible transgenic mice and was shown to be a function of endogenous cyclin D1 using mammary epithelial cell tissue-specific cyclin D1 knockout. In the mammary epithelium and in tissue culture, cyclin A2 levels were unchanged, evidencing that the mechanism by which cyclin D1 augments Akt1 activity is distinct from cyclin A2-induced phosphorylation at S477/T479."

Cyclin D1 was sufficient to reconstitute the Akt1 transcriptional signaling program, and membrane-tethered cyclin D1 was sufficient to reconstitute the 2.5-fold induction of c-fos-LUC seen with the rescue by WT cyclin D1. Importantly, signaling to the c-fos promoter by membrane-tethered cyclin D1 occurred via the TCF site. which is known to be activated by EGF-Akt. In contrast, the SRF site, which responds to serum-induced signals via Rac/Rho, was not involved in activation of c-fos-LUC activity by membrane-tethered cyclin D1. Although the signaling to the SRE and TCF sites is complex, our findings are consistent with a model in which membrane-tethered cyclin D1 augments an Akt signaling pathway. The noncanonical functions of cyclin D1 include the ability to regulate gene transcription via specific target transcription factors. Such activity has been designated as a nuclear transcriptional activity mediated by a pool of cyclin D1 located in the context of chromatin. The present studies extend these findings by demonstrating that, in addition to the nuclear transcriptional activity of cyclin D1, a membrane-associated cyclin D1 also augments gene transcription via phosphorylation of Akt1 and, thereby, induction of downstream signaling."

The neuromodulin fragment contains a signal for posttranslational palmitoylation of cysteines 3 and 4 that targets ECFP to cellular membranes.

Recent studies identified a dichromic fluorescent (DCF) dye substrate for cellular Akt1 activity. The diserine DCF substrate was shown to serve as a specific substrate for Akt1, which can be used to quantitatively assess the enzyme's activity in real time. Insulin activation of cellular Akt phosphorylates a single serine residue of the diserine DCF substrate in a time-dependent manner and can be used to assess longitudinally the stimulation and reversibility of Akt1 activity. The dichromic dye LS456 is phosphorylated by Akt1 but not a variety of other kinases (including protein kinase A [PKA], PKC, RSK1, P70S6K, and PI3K). The binding of insulin to its cell-surface receptor stimulates PI3K, which then induces the second messenger, phosphotidylinositol-3, 4, 5-triphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 activates Akt and additional downstream effectors. As LS456 was shown to serve as a specific substrate for Akt1 in response to 150 nM insulin, we examined the kinetics of insulin-mediated activation of LS456 in in cyclin D1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared with WT MEFs (Figure 5A). Insulin stimulation of Akt1 activity assessed by LS456 was delayed with reduced induction in cyclin D1-/- cells compared with the cyclin D1+/+ cells (Figure 5A). The response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) was also delayed (Figure 5B). Analysis in Cdk4/Cdk6-/- MEFs demonstrated a delayed and reduced induction of insulin- and EGF-mediated activation of LS456 in Cdk4/Cdk6-/- MEFs compared with WT MEFs (Figures 5C and 5D).",

In order to determine whether cyclin D1 rescue of cyclin D1-/- cells augmented cell-cycle progression during this time frame, we compared the cyclin D1-/- and cyclin D1-/-cyclin D1WT rescued cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis demonstrated trivial differences in cell-cycle distribution in the 0- to 4-h time frame, with an augmentation of S phase enrichment (9.9 versus 13.5) occurring at 24 h (Figure S9A). CDK inhibitors have been shown to reduce the RB kinase function of the cyclin D1/CDK4 complex; however, significant additional interactions have been identified (reviewed in), warranting an analysis of CDK inhibitor impact on Akt1 phosphorylation at Ser473 and the interaction with Rictor. To this end, we deployed MEFs encoding tamoxifen-inducible Rictor small interfering RNA (siRNA). Acute reduction in Rictor abundance reduced Akt1 Ser473 compared with Akt1 (Figure S9B, lane 1 versus lane 4). The addition of the two distinct CDK inhibitors palbociclib (8 mum) or abemociclib (8 mum) reduced RB phosphorylation at Ser780 without significant effects on the relative phosphorylation of Akt1 Ser473 (Figure S9B, lanes 1 versus lanes 2 and 3). The reduction on RB phosphorylation by acute siRictor may be due to the previously described reduction in cyclin D1. In contrast, after chronic reduction in Rictor (30 days), the addition of a CDK inhibitor:abemaciclib (4-8 mum) or palbociclib (4-8 mum):reduced Akt1 Ser473 abundance compared with that of Akt1 (Figure S9C, lane 1 versus lane 5). Together, these studies are consistent with the known importance of Rictor to induce Akt1 Ser473 phosphorylation, and the new evidence herein that endogenous cyclin D/CDK4/6 activity augments Akt1 Ser473 phosphorylation, in part dependent upon the relative activity of Rictor in the cells.",

Cyclin D1 restored phosphorylation of Akt1 at Ser473. Previous studies identified an association between cyclin D1 and cytoplasmic membrane proteins, including PACSIN 2, Filamin A, and Paxillin; and several components of the cell-cycle control apparatus are located in the cytoplasmic membrane, including cyclin D1, p27Kip1, and p16INK4a. Although the physiological function of cytoplasmic-membrane-associated cell-cycle components was previously not well understood, p16INK4a and CDK6 co-localized in membrane ruffles of spreading cells and functioned upstream of alpha-v-beta3-dependent activation of PKC to regulate matrix-dependent cell migration.
