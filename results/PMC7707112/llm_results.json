The serine threonine kinase Akt plays a pivotal role in the control of cellular metabolism, survival, and mitogenic signaling. Herein, Akt1-mediated phosphorylation of downstream substrates in the mammary gland is reduced by cyclin D1 genetic deletion and is induced by mammary-gland-targeted cyclin D1 overexpression. Cyclin D1 is associated with Akt1 and augments the rate of onset and maximal cellular Akt1 activity induced by mitogens. Cyclin D1 is identified in a cytoplasmic-membrane-associated pool, and cytoplasmic-membrane-localized cyclin D1:but not nuclear-localized cyclin D1:recapitulates Akt1 transcriptional function. These studies identify a novel extranuclear function of cyclin D1 to enhance proliferative functions via augmenting Akt1 phosphorylation at Ser473.",

            "text": "Akt activation occurs through a complex, multistep, phosphorylation-dependent mechanism that is incompletely understood. Akt is phosphorylated in response to growth factor signaling by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK1) in the activation loop (Thr308) and by mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) in the C-terminal hydrophobic motif (Ser473). Reflecting the diverse cellular contexts in which AKT plays a role, Akt S473 phosphorylation is enhanced by many signaling pathways, including IKKalpha; the serine threonine kinase integrin-linked kinase (ILK); members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinase (PIKK) family, including DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKc), mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2, (p38), protein kinase CbII (PKCbII); ataxia-telangiectasia mutant; and ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3 related. BSD-domain-containing signal transducer and Akt interactor (BSTA) also promote phosphorylation of Akt1 at Ser473. The priming phosphorylation by Akt1-pS477/pT479 is mediated by Cdk2/cyclin A, mTORC2, or DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) under cell-cycle progression, growth factor stimulation, or DNA-damaging conditions, respectively. Akt activity fluctuates across the cell cycle. Under cell-cycle conditions, the cyclin A/cdk2 priming phosphorylation becomes more important and is, therefore, relatively mTORC2/Rictor independent. These distinct signaling cascades play differing roles under different physiological perturbations. For example, inactivation of mTORC2 by depleting Rictor led to a more dramatic reduction of Akt1-pS477/pT479 in response to insulin than under synchronized cell-cycle conditions. Furthermore, the cyclin A/cdk2-mediated priming of S477/479 was considered to be important in cellular transformation.",

In prior studies, estrogen dendrimers that were functionally excluded from the nucleus determined cyclin D1-dependent estrogen signaling, suggesting that the estrogen-dependent attenuation of the DNA damage response involves an extranuclear pool of cyclin D1.

In order to determine at a higher level of resolution the mechanisms by which cyclin D1 expression induced mitogenic signaling, we examined proliferative kinase activity in the mammary gland of transgenic mice in which either the cyclin D1 cDNA or a point mutant of the cyclin D1 cDNA K112E (cyclin D1KE) was intercrossed with MMTV-RtTA mice to ensure doxycycline-inducible expression of cyclin D1 in the mammary gland of mice (Figure 1A). The cyclin D1 cDNA K112E (cyclin D1KE) generates a mutation previously shown to convey reduced ability to phosphorylate RB. Animals were treated for 14 days, and analysis of Akt1 and Akt1 Ser473 was conducted by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using an Akt1 isoform-specific antibody (Figure 1; Figure S1). The presence of the cyclin D1 transgene was confirmed by IHC to the amino-terminal FLAG epitope of the cyclin D1 cDNA in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Figure 1B). Induction of the cyclin D1 transgene was associated with increased phosphorylation of Akt1 Ser473, which was seen in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, without a change in Akt1 abundance. Consistent with cyclin D1-mediated activation of Akt1, several downstream targets of Akt were measured in the mammary epithelial cell of the mammary gland in the bi-transgenic mice after induction of the cyclin D1 transgene by doxycycline (TSC2 Ser939, FKHR Ser319, and BAD Ser136) (Figures S1B-S1E).",

Similar levels of cyclin D1WT and cyclin D1KE mutant proteins were identified within the cell by western blot (Figure 2C). Re-expression of cyclin D1 in cyclin D1-/- cells enhanced Akt1 phosphorylation at Ser473. However, cyclin D1KE abrogated the induction of Akt1 phosphorylation (Figure 2C). In order to consider potential mechanism by which cyclin D1 augmented Akt1 activity, we considered the possibility that cyclin D1 directly phosphorylated Akt1. Cyclin D1 immune-precipitation kinase assays were conducted using immune-precipitated cyclin D1 from HEK293T cells overexpressing cyclin D1 as the enzyme source and expressed proteins including a pRB fragment that encodes two CDK phosphorylation sites and full-length immune-purified human Akt1 (Figures 2D and 2E) as substrates. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein input was electrophoresed and stained with Coomassie, and the gamma32p incorporated product was compared in order to derive relative incorporation of gamma32p into the substrates (Figures 2D and 2E). Next, HEK293T cells were transfected with expression vector encoding hemagglutinin (HA)-Akt1 and either vector or FLAG N-amino-terminal tagged cyclin D1WT. HA immunoprecipitation (HA-IP) was conducted on the cells, and mass spectrometry compared the relative abundance in post-translational modification between vector control and cyclin D1-transfected cells (Figure 2F). As Akt1 Ser473 was identified in western blot and by mass spectrometry as a residue phosphorylated in response to cyclin D1 expression, cyclin D1 IP kinase assays were conducted of Akt1 WT versus Akt1 S473A. In contrast with Akt1 WT, point mutation of Akt1 Ser473 reduced gamma32p incorporated by -80-fold (Figure 2G). This study demonstrates that RB and Akt1 serve as efficient substrates in cyclin D1 immune complex kinase assays (Figures 2D-2E).

Figure 3A shows the signal identified when cyclin D1 was introduced into cyclin D1-/- 3T3 cells, whereas background signal only was identified in cells transduced with a control vector (GFP) (Figure 3B) or with control immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Figures S6 and S7). The signal was primarily extranuclear based on DAPI (blue staining) (Figure 3A). The signal for Akt1 and cyclin D1 proximity was maintained with a mutant of cyclin D1 (cyclin D1KE), which is defective in several functions, including kinase activity (Figure 3C). A mutant of a carboxy-terminal cyclin D1 phosphorylation site (cyclin D1T286) that is known to be primarily nuclear in localization did not show association with Akt1 (Figure 3D; Figure S8). Deletion of the acidic rich carboxy-terminal motif from cyclin D1 (cyclinDeltaE) maintained binding to Akt1; however, deletion of the N-terminal residues 1-91 (cyclin D1C6) abrogated Akt1 binding (Figure 3E-3G), and mutants including deletions of this region (e.g., cyclin D1C4 and cyclin D1C5) also failed to bind Akt1 (Figure S8). The murine cyclin D1/ CDK4/Akt1 (mCD1/CDK4/Akt1) model (Figure 3H) was generated as described in the STAR Methods section. The high sequence identity between mCD1/CDK4/Akt1 and the high-resolution X-ray crystal structures used to generate this model provides a high degree of confidence in the model.

Recent studies identified a dichromic fluorescent (DCF) dye substrate for cellular Akt1 activity. The diserine DCF substrate was shown to serve as a specific substrate for Akt1, which can be used to quantitatively assess the enzyme's activity in real time. Insulin activation of cellular Akt phosphorylates a single serine residue of the diserine DCF substrate in a time-dependent manner and can be used to assess longitudinally the stimulation and reversibility of Akt1 activity. The dichromic dye LS456 is phosphorylated by Akt1 but not a variety of other kinases (including protein kinase A [PKA], PKC, RSK1, P70S6K, and PI3K). The binding of insulin to its cell-surface receptor stimulates PI3K, which then induces the second messenger, phosphotidylinositol-3, 4, 5-triphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 activates Akt and additional downstream effectors. As LS456 was shown to serve as a specific substrate for Akt1 in response to 150 nM insulin, we examined the kinetics of insulin-mediated activation of LS456 in in cyclin D1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared with WT MEFs (Figure 5A). Insulin stimulation of Akt1 activity assessed by LS456 was delayed with reduced induction in cyclin D1-/- cells compared with the cyclin D1+/+ cells (Figure 5A). The response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) was also delayed (Figure 5B). Analysis in Cdk4/Cdk6-/- MEFs demonstrated a delayed and reduced induction of insulin- and EGF-mediated activation of LS456 in Cdk4/Cdk6-/- MEFs compared with WT MEFs (Figures 5C and 5D).",

In order to determine whether cyclin D1 rescue of cyclin D1-/- cells augmented cell-cycle progression during this time frame, we compared the cyclin D1-/- and cyclin D1-/-cyclin D1WT rescued cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis demonstrated trivial differences in cell-cycle distribution in the 0- to 4-h time frame, with an augmentation of S phase enrichment (9.9 versus 13.5) occurring at 24 h (Figure S9A). CDK inhibitors have been shown to reduce the RB kinase function of the cyclin D1/CDK4 complex; however, significant additional interactions have been identified (reviewed in), warranting an analysis of CDK inhibitor impact on Akt1 phosphorylation at Ser473 and the interaction with Rictor. To this end, we deployed MEFs encoding tamoxifen-inducible Rictor small interfering RNA (siRNA). Acute reduction in Rictor abundance reduced Akt1 Ser473 compared with Akt1 (Figure S9B, lane 1 versus lane 4). The addition of the two distinct CDK inhibitors palbociclib (8 mum) or abemociclib (8 mum) reduced RB phosphorylation at Ser780 without significant effects on the relative phosphorylation of Akt1 Ser473 (Figure S9B, lanes 1 versus lanes 2 and 3). The reduction on RB phosphorylation by acute siRictor may be due to the previously described reduction in cyclin D1. In contrast, after chronic reduction in Rictor (30 days), the addition of a CDK inhibitor:abemaciclib (4-8 mum) or palbociclib (4-8 mum):reduced Akt1 Ser473 abundance compared with that of Akt1 (Figure S9C, lane 1 versus lane 5). Together, these studies are consistent with the known importance of Rictor to induce Akt1 Ser473 phosphorylation, and the new evidence herein that endogenous cyclin D/CDK4/6 activity augments Akt1 Ser473 phosphorylation, in part dependent upon the relative activity of Rictor in the cells.",

In contrast, nuclear-targeted cyclin D1 failed to induce c-fos promoter activity (Figure 6H). The myr-Akt1 expression vector induced c-fos-LUC activity ~4- to 6-fold, and membrane-tethered cyclin D1 induced c-fos-LUC activity ~2.5-fold. There was no difference in c-fos-LUC activation by membrane-tethered cyclin D1 versus cyclin D1WT (Figures 6F and 6G). There was no further induction of c-fos-LUC activity by membrane-tethered cyclin D1 in the presence of myr-Akt1. The activity of pm12-LUC is higher than that of WT (c-fos-LUC) in the presence of myr-AKT1. Pm12 has a mutation of the SRE site, which reduces basal level activity maintained by Akt-independent signaling pathways in the cell. pm12-LUC maintains WT activation by Akt1. Therefore, when the activity of pm12 is normalized to 1 for basal level activity, the relative activity of pm12 in the presence of Akt1 is greater.

Previous studies identified an association between cyclin D1 and cytoplasmic membrane proteins, including PACSIN 2, Filamin A, and Paxillin; and several components of the cell-cycle control apparatus are located in the cytoplasmic membrane, including cyclin D1, p27Kip1, and p16INK4a. Although the physiological function of cytoplasmic-membrane-associated cell-cycle components was previously not well understood, p16INK4a and CDK6 co-localized in membrane ruffles of spreading cells and functioned upstream of alpha-v-beta3-dependent activation of PKC to regulate matrix-dependent cell migration.

Cyclin D1 was sufficient to reconstitute the Akt1 transcriptional signaling program, and membrane-tethered cyclin D1 was sufficient to reconstitute the 2.5-fold induction of c-fos-LUC seen with the rescue by WT cyclin D1. Importantly, signaling to the c-fos promoter by membrane-tethered cyclin D1 occurred via the TCF site. which is known to be activated by EGF-Akt. In contrast, the SRF site, which responds to serum-induced signals via Rac/Rho, was not involved in activation of c-fos-LUC activity by membrane-tethered cyclin D1. Although the signaling to the SRE and TCF sites is complex, our findings are consistent with a model in which membrane-tethered cyclin D1 augments an Akt signaling pathway. The noncanonical functions of cyclin D1 include the ability to regulate gene transcription via specific target transcription factors. Such activity has been designated as a nuclear transcriptional activity mediated by a pool of cyclin D1 located in the context of chromatin. The present studies extend these findings by demonstrating that, in addition to the nuclear transcriptional activity of cyclin D1, a membrane-associated cyclin D1 also augments gene transcription via phosphorylation of Akt1 and, thereby, induction of downstream signaling.",

As cyclin D1 tethered to the membrane induced Akt1 transcriptional activity, we sought to determine whether increased cyclin D1 expression correlated with increased Akt1 gene signaling in human breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, we generated a surrogate measure of Akt1 genetic activity by creating an Akt1 genetic signature. The Akt1 activity genetic signature was derived by comparing genetic deletion of Akt1 with Akt1 WT mammary gland. In order to interrogate cyclin D1 and Akt1-mediated gene expression, we interrogated a superset of 2,254 breast cancer samples and samples from healthy breast tissue. This study shows that increased cyclin D1 expression correlated with increased Akt1-mediated gene activity. The abundance of cyclin D1 gene expression correlated with the gene signature for Akt1-induced activity in normal breast tissue and in breast cancer samples. Furthermore, cyclin D1 expression and the Akt1-induced gene expression signature were positively correlated in each genetic subtype of breast cancer. Furthermore, genome-wide expression analysis of murine mammary glands from mice with the Akt1 gene deletion and mice with the cyclin D1 gene deletion demonstrated substantial overlap in KEGG functions, including the \"cell-cycle\" and \"insulin signaling\" pathways and \"mTOR signaling,\" consistent with the phenotype of cyclin D1-/- and Akt1-/- mice, which share several common features, including defective mammary gland development. Together, these studies are consistent with a model in which cyclin D1 induction correlates with increased Akt1-target gene activity.",

Under cell-cycle conditions, the cyclin A/Cdk2 priming phosphorylation becomes more important and is, therefore, relatively mTORC2/Rictor independent. We propose that Rictor can function upstream of cyclin D1/CDK4/6 (by priming S477/T479 phosphorylation) and, in certain physiological circumstances, in parallel to mTORC2/Rictor (direct phosphorylation of Ser473). The induction of Akt1 activity by cyclin D1 herein appears to be independent of previously described cell-cycle-related Akt activity, which occurs during the first 15 min to 6 h of the cell cycle, preceding the cell-cycle changes of cyclin D1, which occurred at 16 to 24 h, as assessed herein by FACS analysis. The Sin1 component of mTORC2 binds hyper-phosphorylated RB, which inhibits mTORC2-mediated activation of Akt. Although our studies did not directly address the role of pRB/Sin1 in regulating Akt1 activity, the mechanisms of the two studies appear to be distinct. Cyclin A2 can induce Akt1 activity; however, herein, cyclin A2 levels were unchanged by cyclin D1 expression in the mammary gland of mice in which cyclin D1 was either overexpressed or reduced in abundance. Similarly, the cyclin D1 rescue analysis in 3T3 cells conducted herein showed induction of cyclin D1, but not cyclin A, abundance.",

The procedure for semi-quantification involved first opening the image software, then in the heading dropdown menu selecting the option of \"image,\" then clicking on the menu item \"color\" then \"color deconvolution\" with selection of \"H&E, DAB.\" This procedure splits the original image into H&E and DAB-images.

Subsequently, under the heading dropdown menu entitled \"analyze\" was activated, then the menu item entitled \"setup measurement\" and then \"integrated intensity\" were selected. Within the threshold-image modality, the heading \"measure\" in the heading drop down menu and then the heading \"analyze\" were chosen to obtain the results of integrated intensity. In the H-images setting, the threshold to cover the target nuclear staining was established, then the heading dropdown menu titled \"process\" was selected followed by activating the operation entitled \"binary,\" then \"fill holes\" and then \"watershed.\" The heading dropdown menu item titled \"analyze,\" was then used, activating the item titled \"analyze particles\" and then within the pop-out menu, the target size was defined, \"show outlines\" and \"summary\" were selected, and then clicking \"ok\" to obtain the total cell number. The relative intensity was calculated by dividing the integrated intensity with the total cell number. In order to obtain the ratio of positive cells, the DAB-image was processed as an H-image above to obtain the total number of positive cells. The ratio was calculated by dividing the total positive cell number with the total cell number. Double check if the outline images of the nucleoli matched the staining shown in the original images and if not, therefore it was necessary to count the cell number manually.",
