Paneth cells provide stem cell niche factors in homeostatic conditions, but the underlying mechanisms of cancer stem cell niche development are unclear. Here, we report that Dickkopf-2 (DKK2) is essential for the generation of cancer cells with Paneth cell properties during colon cancer metastasis. Splenic injection of Dkk2 knockout (KO) cancer organoids into C57BL/6 mice resulted in a significant reduction of liver metastases. Transcriptome analysis showed reduction of Paneth cell markers such as lysozymes in KO organoids. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses of murine metastasized colon cancer cells and patient samples identified the presence of lysozyme positive cells with Paneth cell properties including enhanced glycolysis. Further analyses of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility suggested hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) as a downstream target of DKK2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing analysis revealed that HNF4A binds to the promoter region of Sox9, a well-known transcription factor for Paneth cell differentiation. In the liver metastatic foci, DKK2 knockout rescued HNF4A protein levels followed by reduction of lysozyme positive cancer cells. Taken together, DKK2-mediated reduction of HNF4A protein promotes the generation of lysozyme positive cancer cells with Paneth cell properties in the metastasized colon cancers."

Accumulating oncogenic mutations in Kras, Trp53, and Smad4 genes facilitate colorectal carcinogenesis and metastasis. Recent studies have identified that Lgr5 positive cells are required for metastasis in the murine models of colorectal cancer. Lgr5 positive cells include stem cells, transit amplifying cells and Paneth cells. Ablation of Lgr5 positive cells in the primary tumor in mice restricted metastatic progression of colon cancer cells. Time-lapse live imaging analysis of metastatic cancer cells in the murine primary colon tumors revealed that both Lgr5 positive and negative cancer cells are able to escape from the primary tumors and circulate in the bloodstream. Importantly, generation or presence of Lgr5 positive cells is necessary to form metastases, suggesting that cancer stem cells and their niche formation upon metastases seeding is a prerequisite of metastatic tumor growth."

In the homeostatic condition, Paneth cells function as stem cell niche cells by providing Wnt3, EGF, Notch ligand, and Dll4 to intestinal stem cells. Paneth cell-mediated glucose conversion into lactate promotes proliferation of intestinal stem cells that lack glucose metabolism. Stem cell niche factors not only maintain stem cells but also generate new stem cells by dedifferentiation from the progenitors when the original stem cells are damaged by intestinal injury or inflammation. Regeneration of stem cells by niche factors also occurs in the context of colorectal cancer.

Recent findings have identified the presence of Paneth-like cells in the large intestine. However, the existence of Paneth or Paneth-like cells in colon cancers remains unknown. Using colon cancer organoids carrying mutations in Apc, Kras, and Trp53 genes, we showed here that Dkk2 KO disrupted lysozyme (LYZ) positive cell formation in colon cancer organoids as well as metastatic nodules in vivo. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses for mouse and human metastatic colon cancer samples have identified the existence of LYZ+ cells exhibiting Paneth cell properties including metabolic support for stem cells. Mechanistically, DKK2 protein deficiency recovered protein levels of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) in colon cancer cells. HNF4A binding on the Sox9 promoter inhibited the formation of LYZ+ cancer cells exhibiting Paneth cell characteristics. The loss of LYZ+ cells by Dkk2 knockout rescued mice from the liver metastasis of colorectal cancer induced by cancer organoid transplantation. Our findings suggest that DKK2 promotes LYZ+ cell formation exhibiting Paneth cell properties to develop cancer stem cell niches for outgrowth of metastasized colon cancers."

The ablation of Lgr5-expressing cells in primary colon tumors inhibited metastasis whereas the growth of primary tumors quickly recovered by dedifferentiation of non-stem cells into Lgr5-expressing stem cells. Moreover, Fumagalli et al. have shown that Lgr5-expressing cells are indispensable for the growth of metastases. We have recently reported that DKK2 enhanced Lgr5 expression in colon cancers through activation of c-Src. Enhanced activation of c-Src has been reported in metastatic colon cancers as well. Based on these observations, we queried whether DKK2 is required for metastasis of colorectal cancer. We developed colon cancer organoids carrying oncogenic mutations in Apc, Kras, and Trp53 genes (AKP). Splenic injection of the Dkk2 knockout AKP (KO) organoids into wild-type C57BL/6 mice resulted in significantly less liver metastasis and mortality compared to the control (AKP) organoids (Figure 1A-D). Quantitative gene expression analyses revealed that the levels of Dkk2 and Lgr5 were still decreased in KO-derived liver metastasized cells compared to AKP-derived cells (Figure 1E). Lgr5 protein expression and c-Src phosphorylation were reduced in KO-derived liver tumors (Figure 1F and G). The percentage of Lgr5-expressing cells with c-Src phosphorylation in KO tumor tissues was decreased about twofold compared to AKP tissues (Figure 1H). These data suggest the necessity of DKK2 in the growth of Lgr5-expressing cancer stem cells in liver metastasized nodules originated from the splenic injection of cancer organoids."

KO organoids were generated using the CRISPR technique and DKK2 reconstitution was followed using recombinant mouse DKK2 protein (Figure 2A). Consistent with our previous report using a colitis-induced tumor model, expression of stem cell marker genes including Lgr5 was reduced in KO organoids (Figure 2:figure supplement 1). In particular, the expression of Paneth cell marker genes such as Lyz1, Lyz2, and alpha defensins were significantly reduced in KO organoids (Figure 2:figure supplement 1). Paneth cells are derived from Lgr5-expressing stem cells by asymmetric division and maintain their Lgr5 expression. These cells produce stem cell niche factors such as Wnt3A in order to facilitate stem cell proliferation and differentiation into other epithelial lineage cells. Paneth cells are also crucial for the glycolysis of intestinal stem cells that lack of glucose metabolism. Our bulk RNA-seq data showed that Paneth cell-derived Wnt3a as well as Fgfr3, a marker of Paneth cell-induced expansion of stem cells, were reduced by Dkk2 knockout, indicating that the formation of stem cell niche might be disrupted in KO organoids (Figure 2:figure supplement 1). Indeed, formation of LYZ+ cells was disrupted by Dkk2 knockout during organoid culture (Figure 2C). LYZ+ cells were detected in AKP organoids from day 2 after plating a single or multiple cells of enzyme-digested organoids whereas those cells were less frequently observed in KO organoids. It correlates to the expression pattern of Lgr5 in our previous report. A significant increase of Lgr5 expression was observed between day 2 and day 4 and peaked at day 4 to day 6 in AKP organoid culture. Lgr5 expression was reduced about threefold in KO organoids compared to AKP organoids at day 8. Likewise, the markers of Paneth cells, Lyz1 and Lyz2, were reduced in KO organoids at day 8 and recombinant mouse DKK2 protein treatment into KO organoids partially rescued it (Figure 2D). These data indicate that DKK2 is necessary for LYZ+ cell formation in colon cancer organoids that might be required for the cancer stem cell niche formation."

Total of 17 cells in cluster 6 were further defined as cancer cells with Paneth cell properties (Paneth+) or goblet cell properties (Goblet+) using the relevant marker genes expression, Lyz1, Muc2, and Atoh1 (Figure 3:figure supplement 1). The calculated ratio between Paneth+ cells and Goblet+ cells in KO metastasized tumors was 0.43, reduced as half compared to the ratio in the AKP control, 1.

Elevated expression of stem cell marker genes represents cancer stemness in Lgr5 positive cells compared to Lgr5 negative cells. The UMAP plot of Lgr5 positive cells displayed two clusters. Interestingly, expression of Noggin (Nog), one of the stem cell niche factors, was detected mostly in cluster 1 where only one cell was counted in KO. Noggin is an inhibitor of BMP signaling, which restricts stemness of Lgr5 positive stem cells in the gut. Following the reduction of Nog, Bmp4 expression was reversed in KO tumor epithelial cells in the scRNA-seq data (Figure 3:figure supplement 2). This has been confirmed by quantitative gene expression analysis of Bmp4 in KO organoids. The correlative expression between Dkk2 and the stem cell marker gene, Lgr5, has been shown in the scRNA-seq data (Figure 3B). Furthermore, pathways enrichment analysis of the scRNA-seq data using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) suggested that the glycolysis I pathway was significantly inhibited in KO Lgr5 positive tumor epithelial cells (Figure 3C). Expression of glycolysis-related genes such as Aldoa, Aldoc, and Fbp2 was reduced by Dkk2 knockout in Lgr5 positive cells (Figure 3D). Previous studies have defined that Paneth cells participate in the regulation of energy metabolism in intestinal stem cells. Since stem cells are not able to generate lactate, Paneth cells instead process glucose in order to provide lactate to stem cells.

Loss of the HNF4alpha1 isoform was also observed in AKP organoids while Dkk2 knockout restored the presence of HNF4alpha1 protein in the nucleus of AKP organoid cells. This allowed us to investigate the binding regions of HNF4alpha1 in colon cancer cells using KO organoids. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis using the ChIP-seq grade anti-HNF4A antibody revealed that HNF4A binds to the promoter region of Sox9 in KO organoid cells (Figure 6D). Sox9 is a transcription factor required for the secretory lineage of epithelial cell differentiation including Paneth cells. Quantitative gene expression analysis showed that Dkk2 knockout reduced Sox9 expression in AKP organoids, which was rescued by recombinant DKK2 protein treatment (Figure 6E). Reduced Sox9 expression in KO organoids was also reversed by HNF4alpha1 knockdown (Figure 6F). These data indicate that DKK2-driven loss of HNF4alpha1 protein leads to Sox9 expression followed by formation of LYZ+ colon cancer cells. Confocal microscopy analysis confirmed that HNF4alpha1 knockdown rescued the presence of LYZ+ cancer cells in KO organoids (Figure 6G). In order to quantify LYZ+ cancer cells in the mouse model of liver metastasis, tdTomato positive cells in the liver were identified as the implanted organoid-derived cancer cells then, LYZ+ cells were calculated (Figure 6H).

These findings suggest that DKK2 is indispensable for the generation of LYZ+ cancer cells in liver metastasized nodules by reducing protein levels of HNF4alpha1. Further analyses for human colorectal cancer scRNA-seq data revealed that HNF4A regulation activity is reduced in LYZ+ human colon cancer cells compared to the LYZ- cancer cells while SOX9 regulation activity is significantly increased (Figure 6J and K) suggesting the key roles of HNF4A and SOX9 in LYZ+ cancer cell formation in human.

Indeed, Paneth cell-derived stem cell niche factors such as Wnt3, EGF, and Dll4 are essential for the maintenance of stem cells. Dietary-induced mouse sporadic intestinal cancer showed elevation of Paneth cell marker genes in the intestinal epithelium. IDO1+ Paneth cells contribute to the immune evasion of colon cancer.

Recent studies have reported stem cell niche remodeling in the primary tumor in the presence of oncogenic mutations. Cancer stem cells outcompete their neighboring normal stem cells during intestinal tumorigenesis, which is known as clonal fixation. Apc-mutant cancer cells secrete several Wnt antagonists such as NOTUM to inhibit proliferation of normal intestinal stem cells and facilitate their differentiation. Other oncogenic mutations in Kras or Pi3kca genes lead to paracrine secretion of BMP ligands, remodeling the stem cell niche that is detrimental for maintaining normal stem cells. These changes are beneficial for the outgrowth of cancer stem cells in the crypt where the stem cell niche had been developed prior to tumorigenesis. In the context of metastasis, the formation of stem cell niches is required upon metastases seeding in the liver. We have shown that DKK2 is required for the formation of LYZ+ cancer cells carrying Paneth cell properties. DKK2 expression is induced by Apc knockout and further increased by additional oncogenic mutations in Kras and Trp53 genes. Characterization of DKK2-induced LYZ+ cancer cells will provide better understanding of the biology of cancer stem cell niches, particularly in liver metastases of colorectal cancer."

        "text": "DKK2 expression in colon cancer promotes LYZ+ cancer cell generation through the regulation of HNF4alpha1, which suppresses expression of Sox9, the transcription factor for Paneth cell differentiation. It has been recently reported that HNF4alpha2 isoform acts as an upstream regulator of Wnt3 and Paneth cell differentiation implying the roles of HNF4A for Paneth cell differentiation in the homeostatic condition. Using VillinCre-Apcfloxed mice, Suzuki et al. have confirmed that HNF4A proteins are completely absent in cancer cells with high beta-catenin activity along with increased Sox9 expression. Sox9 regulates cell proliferation and is required for Paneth cell differentiation. Bi-allelic inactivation of the Apc gene induces Sox9 expression in colon cancer. Likewise, Apc inactivation induces Dkk2 expression. Here, we showed that DKK2-mediated HNF4alpha1 protein degradation enhanced Sox9 expression in colon cancer (Figure 7). Notably, Apc mutation-driven Sox9 expression blocks intestinal differentiation and activates stem cell-like program. This is consistent with our previous report that DKK2 enhances Lgr5 expression in colon cancer. In sum, our findings suggest that a Wnt ligand, DKK2, is an upstream regulator of SOX9 expression for enhanced stem cell activity via the formation of LYZ+ cells with Paneth cell characteristics in colorectal cancers."

DKK2 is required for the formation of LYZ+ colon cancer cells exhibiting Paneth cell properties such as glycolysis for stem cells. Glycolysis in Lgr5-expressing cancer cells was reduced along with the loss of LYZ+ cells by Dkk2 knockout. As a result, metastatic growth of colon cancer cells was significantly inhibited in vivo. These findings suggest the necessity of DKK2 in the development of cancer stem cell niches for developing metastases. Mechanistically, DKK2-mediated degradation of HNF4alpha1 protein elevated Sox9 expression followed by LYZ+ cell formation. Given that DKK2 expression is intestinal tumor specific, inhibition of DKK2 may have promising therapeutic outcomes in the treatment of metastatic colon cancer."

Quantitative gene expression analysis showed no significant changes in Hnf4a1 expression upon Dkk2 deletion. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of RNA-Seq data and ATAC-seq data point to a Hnf4a1 motif as a potential target.

Regarding liver survival, it is well known that stem cell niche formation is a critical step for the outgrowth of metastasized cancer cells (Fumagalli et al. 2019, Cell Stem Cell). LYZ+ Paneth cells are recognized as stem cell niche cells in the intestine, and human scRNA-seq data have shown that LYZ+ cancer cells express stem cell niche factors such as Wnt and Notch ligands. To determine whether LYZ+ cancer cells act as stem cell niche cells, we performed confocal microscopy to assess whether LYZ+ cancer cells express WNT3A and DLL4 in AKP organoids (Author response image 4). The results show that LYZ labeling co-localizes with DLL4 and WNT3A expression, while the organoid reporter tdTomato is evenly distributed. Additionally, our in vitro and in vivo data indicate that DKK2 deficiency leads to a reduction of LYZ+ cancer cells, which may contribute to stem cell niche formation. Based on these findings, we propose that DKK2 is an essential factor for stem cell niche formation, which is required for cancer cell survival in the liver during the early stages of metastasis. Although our revised data confirmed the trend that DKK2 deficiency decreases liver metastasis, we have not yet determined whether DKK2 is involved in extravasation. This research topic should be addressed in future studies."
