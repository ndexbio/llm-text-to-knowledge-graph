Splenic injection of Dkk2 knockout (KO) cancer organoids into C57BL/6 mice resulted in a significant reduction of liver metastases.

Paneth cells provide stem cell niche factors in homeostatic conditions, but the underlying mechanisms of cancer stem cell niche development are unclear. Here, we report that Dickkopf-2 (DKK2) is essential for the generation of cancer cells with Paneth cell properties during colon cancer metastasis. Splenic injection of Dkk2 knockout (KO) cancer organoids into C57BL/6 mice resulted in a significant reduction of liver metastases. Transcriptome analysis showed reduction of Paneth cell markers such as lysozymes in KO organoids. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses of murine metastasized colon cancer cells and patient samples identified the presence of lysozyme positive cells with Paneth cell properties including enhanced glycolysis. Further analyses of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility suggested hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) as a downstream target of DKK2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing analysis revealed that HNF4A binds to the promoter region of Sox9, a well-known transcription factor for Paneth cell differentiation. In the liver metastatic foci, DKK2 knockout rescued HNF4A protein levels followed by reduction of lysozyme positive cancer cells. Taken together, DKK2-mediated reduction of HNF4A protein promotes the generation of lysozyme positive cancer cells with Paneth cell properties in the metastasized colon cancers.",

KO organoids were generated using the CRISPR technique and DKK2 reconstitution was followed using recombinant mouse DKK2 protein (Figure 2A). Consistent with our previous report using a colitis-induced tumor model, expression of stem cell marker genes including Lgr5 was reduced in KO organoids (Figure 2:figure supplement 1). In particular, the expression of Paneth cell marker genes such as Lyz1, Lyz2, and alpha defensins were significantly reduced in KO organoids (Figure 2:figure supplement 1). Paneth cells are derived from Lgr5-expressing stem cells by asymmetric division and maintain their Lgr5 expression. These cells produce stem cell niche factors such as Wnt3A in order to facilitate stem cell proliferation and differentiation into other epithelial lineage cells. Paneth cells are also crucial for the glycolysis of intestinal stem cells that lack of glucose metabolism. Our bulk RNA-seq data showed that Paneth cell-derived Wnt3a as well as Fgfr3, a marker of Paneth cell-induced expansion of stem cells, were reduced by Dkk2 knockout, indicating that the formation of stem cell niche might be disrupted in KO organoids (Figure 2:figure supplement 1). Indeed, formation of LYZ+ cells was disrupted by Dkk2 knockout during organoid culture (Figure 2C). LYZ+ cells were detected in AKP organoids from day 2 after plating a single or multiple cells of enzyme-digested organoids whereas those cells were less frequently observed in KO organoids. It correlates to the expression pattern of Lgr5 in our previous report. A significant increase of Lgr5 expression was observed between day 2 and day 4 and peaked at day 4 to day 6 in AKP organoid culture. Lgr5 expression was reduced about threefold in KO organoids compared to AKP organoids at day 8. Likewise, the markers of Paneth cells, Lyz1 and Lyz2, were reduced in KO organoids at day 8 and recombinant mouse DKK2 protein treatment into KO organoids partially rescued it (Figure 2D).

In order to analyze transcriptome changes by Dkk2 knockout in each cell type of metastasized tumors, we performed scRNA-seq analysis on liver metastasized AKP and KO tumor cells. The Louvain method revealed four clusters in our dataset. A cell type was assigned to each cluster on the basis of gene expression patterns and visualized in a uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) representation (Figure 3A). Epithelial tumor cells were sub-clustered as seven clusters and the cluster 6 has been identified as cancer cells with Paneth cell properties based on the expression of Paneth marker genes using the Panglao database (Figure 3A). Total of 17 cells in cluster 6 were further defined as cancer cells with Paneth cell properties (Paneth+) or goblet cell properties (Goblet+) using the relevant marker genes expression, Lyz1, Muc2, and Atoh1 (Figure 3:figure supplement 1). The calculated ratio between Paneth+ cells and Goblet+ cells in KO metastasized tumors was 0.43, reduced as half compared to the ratio in the AKP control, 1.

However, the presence of Paneth cells or Paneth-like cells within the tumor microenvironment is elusive. To discern the existence of cancer cells exhibiting Paneth cell properties in humans, we conducted an analysis of scRNA-seq data obtained from colorectal cancer patients. Our analysis focused on CD45-EpCAM+ epithelial cells, excluding hematopoietic cells. UMAP plotted 31 clusters of single cells derived from normal tissue, primary tumor, and metastasis samples (Figure 4A and B). Employing LYZ expression and Paneth cell module scores (Pangalo database) as criteria, we have identified LYZ+ cancer cells harboring Paneth cell properties across five clusters (Figure 4C-H, Figure 4:figure supplements 1 and 2). LYZ+ cancer cell population is distinct in metastasis samples (Figure 4E and F). LYZ expression over 2.0 (third quantile, round 1) and Paneth module scores over 0.2 (third quantile, round 2 to avoid getting 0) single cells were identified as LYZ+ cancer cells harboring Paneth cell properties, 1%, 13%, and 24% in normal, primary tumor, and metastasis samples, respectively.

Significant enrichment of the HNF4A binding motif was also detected in the open chromatin regions of KO organoids compared to AKP controls determined by assay for transposase-associated chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) (Figure 6B). In comparison with normal colonic organoids, the HNF4A motif was listed as the most reduced motif in AKP indicating significant reduction of HNF4A-regulated transcription whereas it might be rescued by Dkk2 knockout (Figure 6C). Notably, HNF4A was the only molecule suggested by all of these multi-omics data analyses in both mouse and human. These results suggest HNF4A as a key transcription factor in downstream signaling of DKK2 in colon cancer cells.",

Recent studies have reported stem cell niche remodeling in the primary tumor in the presence of oncogenic mutations. Cancer stem cells outcompete their neighboring normal stem cells during intestinal tumorigenesis, which is known as clonal fixation. Apc-mutant cancer cells secrete several Wnt antagonists such as NOTUM to inhibit proliferation of normal intestinal stem cells and facilitate their differentiation. Other oncogenic mutations in Kras or Pi3kca genes lead to paracrine secretion of BMP ligands, remodeling the stem cell niche that is detrimental for maintaining normal stem cells. These changes are beneficial for the outgrowth of cancer stem cells in the crypt where the stem cell niche had been developed prior to tumorigenesis. In the context of metastasis, the formation of stem cell niches is required upon metastases seeding in the liver. We have shown that DKK2 is required for the formation of LYZ+ cancer cells carrying Paneth cell properties. DKK2 expression is induced by Apc knockout and further increased by additional oncogenic mutations in Kras and Trp53 genes.

Using VillinCre-Apcfloxed mice, Suzuki et al. have confirmed that HNF4A proteins are completely absent in cancer cells with high beta-catenin activity along with increased Sox9 expression.

The general topic of metastatic requirements for colon cancer is of general interest. However, much of the work focuses on characterizing cell populations in a mouse model of hepatic outgrowth via splenic transplantation. In particular, the concept of Paneth-like cells is primarily based on transcriptional programs seen in single-cell RNA sequencing data and needs more validation. Although including human samples is important for potential generality, the strength could be improved by doing immunohistochemistry in primary and metastatic lesions for Lyz+ cancer cells. Experiments that further bolster the causal role of Paneth-like CRC cells in metastasis are needed.",

To address this issue in the future, we plan to develop organoids that express a reporter gene specific for Paneth cells. In this manuscript, we demonstrated a correlation between DKK2 and the formation of LYZ+ cancer cells. In both the splenic injection model (Fig. 1) and the orthotopic transplantation model (Fig. R1-R2), we observed that transplantation of cancer organoids with reduced numbers of LYZ+ cells (KO organoids) led to decreased metastatic tumor formation. The number of LYZ+ cells in KO-transplanted mice remained low in liver metastasized tumor nodules (Fig. 6H-I6). Immunohistochemistry further confirmed that LYZ+ cancer cells were barely detectable in KO samples (Author response image 5). These data suggest that DKK2 is essential for the formation of LYZ+ cancer cells, which are necessary for outgrowth following metastasis.",

However, we encountered challenges in establishing this model effectively. After multiple trials, we observed that many mice did not form primary tumors, and the variability, particularly in metastasis, was difficult to control. Only a few AKP-transplanted mice developed liver metastasis. The representative revision data have been provided above. Nevertheless, we believe that this model needs further improvement and optimization to reliably study metastasis originating from primary tumors.",
