ATF3 also binds to the enhancers/promoters of PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH and recruits p300 to promote expression of these SSP genes. As a result, loss of ATF3 expression impairs serine biosynthesis and the growth of cancer cells in the serine-deprived medium or in mice fed with a serine/glycine-free diet.

Serine can also be converted into glycine while donating one-carbon units for folate-dependent reactions, yielding thymidine and purine bases for nucleotide synthesis or S-adenosylmethione for DNA/protein methylation. In addition to importing serine from the extracellular environment, cells can synthesize serine from the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) through 3 consecutive reactions catalyzed by phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT), and phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH), respectively:a process collectively referred to as the serine synthesis pathway (SSP). Although serine is one of the most consumed amino acids in cultured cells, increased serine biosynthesis is one of many metabolic changes found in cancer and has been shown to be required for rapid tumor growth. Indeed, while PHGDH, the rate-limiting enzyme in SSP, is often overexpressed in human cancer, serine deprivation from the extracellular environment by dietary restriction of serine, or direct blockage of serine biosynthesis via pharmacological inhibition of PHGDH, can inhibit tumor growth and limit metastatic spreads of cancer cells into mouse brains.

Transcriptional regulation of the expression of genes encoding the 3 SSP enzymes, i.e., PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH, appears to be a major mechanism for the regulation of serine biosynthesis. Indeed, the promoters/enhancers of SSP genes contain binding sites for several transcription factors, including activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and c-Myc. Expression of ATF4, a member of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors, can be induced by various cellular stresses (e.g., serine deprivation) through activation of eIF2alpha, which specifically enhances translation of ATF4 mRNA. ATF4 can bind to SSP genes and transactivate their expression to enhance serine biosynthesis and sustain rapid growth of cancer cells under serine-deprived conditions. In line with the important role that SSP plays in the regulation of serine metabolism, knockdown of ATF4 expression largely impairs the growth of cancer cells cultured in serine-deprived media. Interestingly, while the major antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2 transcriptionally induces ATF4 to activate PHGDH and PSAT1 expression in non-small cell lung cancers, KDM4C, a histone H3 lysine 9 demethylase, as well as the transcription factor MYCN, promote transcription of SSP genes in neuroblastoma cells in an ATF4-dependent manner. Thus, ATF4 appears to be the master transcriptional regulator for the serine synthesis pathway and could be targeted for the treatment of cancer.

As ATF3 is a common stress sensor, we sought to determine whether ATF3 expression can also be induced by the metabolic stress caused by serine deprivation. We thus incubated various cells, including immortalized hTERT-RPE1 epithelial cells (RPE in short), U2OS sarcoma cells, PC3 prostate cancer cells, and HCT116 colon cancer cells, in a culture medium deprived of serine and glycine and determined ATF3 expression by western blotting and qRT-PCR assays. The reason why we also depleted glycine from the culture medium was that imported glycine can be converted to serine, thereby bypassing the serine synthesis pathway. Not surprisingly, serine deprivation caused a dramatic increase in both the protein (Figure 1A) and the mRNA level (Figures 1B and 1C) of ATF3, suggesting that serine deprivation likely induced ATF3 expression at the transcription level. Although ATF3 induction was an immediate early event (Figure 1D) and the kinetics of ATF3 induction by serine deprivation varied among cell lines, the ATF3 expression level was decreased to the basal level 48 h after serine deprivation (Figures 1A-1C). The latter results were not unexpected, as ATF3 can bind to and repress its own promoter. Interestingly, although the conversion between serine and glycine is bidirectional, deprivation of only serine from the culture medium was sufficient to induce ATF3 expression while deprivation of glycine only slightly induced ATF3 expression (Figure 1E), in line with the notion that the glycine to serine conversion is not sustainable. As a transient increase of ATF4 expression is the major molecular event in response to serine deprivation, we determined whether ATF3 induction was mediated by ATF4. In line with previous findings that the ATF3 promoter contains a C/EBP-ATF response element (CARE) (5'-TGATGCAA-3'; -23 to -16) that can be bound by ATF4 and is responsible for ATF3 induction, knockdown of ATF4 expression using a previously characterized ATF4 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) almost completely diminished ATF3 induction by serine deprivation (Figure 1F):results unlikely from off-target activities of the ATF4 shRNA as ATF3 induction by serine deprivation was abolished in ATF4-knockout (KO) HEK293T cells as well (; Figure 1G). These results argue for a notion that serine deprivation induced ATF3 expression through a mechanism involving the GCN2-eIF2alpha-ATF4 axis.

In line with previous findings that the ATF3 promoter contains a C/EBP-ATF response element (CARE) (5'-TGATGCAA-3'; -23 to -16) that can be bound by ATF4 and is responsible for ATF3 induction, knockdown of ATF4 expression using a previously characterized ATF4 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) almost completely diminished ATF3 induction by serine deprivation (Figure 1F):results unlikely from off-target activities of the ATF4 shRNA as ATF3 induction by serine deprivation was abolished in ATF4-knockout (KO) HEK293T cells as well (; Figure 1G). These results argue for a notion that serine deprivation induced ATF3 expression through a mechanism involving the GCN2-eIF2alpha-ATF4 axis.

As ATF3 is a common stress sensor, we sought to determine whether ATF3 expression can also be induced by the metabolic stress caused by serine deprivation. We thus incubated various cells, including immortalized hTERT-RPE1 epithelial cells (RPE in short), U2OS sarcoma cells, PC3 prostate cancer cells, and HCT116 colon cancer cells, in a culture medium deprived of serine and glycine and determined ATF3 expression by western blotting and qRT-PCR assays. The reason why we also depleted glycine from the culture medium was that imported glycine can be converted to serine, thereby bypassing the serine synthesis pathway. Not surprisingly, serine deprivation caused a dramatic increase in both the protein (Figure 1A) and the mRNA level (Figures 1B and 1C) of ATF3, suggesting that serine deprivation likely induced ATF3 expression at the transcription level. Although ATF3 induction was an immediate early event (Figure 1D) and the kinetics of ATF3 induction by serine deprivation varied among cell lines, the ATF3 expression level was decreased to the basal level 48 h after serine deprivation (Figures 1A-1C). The latter results were not unexpected, as ATF3 can bind to and repress its own promoter. Interestingly, although the conversion between serine and glycine is bidirectional, deprivation of only serine from the culture medium was sufficient to induce ATF3 expression while deprivation of glycine only slightly induced ATF3 expression (Figure 1E), in line with the notion that the glycine to serine conversion is not sustainable.

Serine deprivation also significantly induced expression of ATF4 and its known targets, including ATF3, ASNS, and DDIT3:genes known to engage in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response (Figure S3B). Out of these genes, ATF3 appeared to be required for inducing 61 genes and repressing 23 genes (Figure 3B; Table S2), which include several genes (e.g., DDIT3, CHAC1, and GDF15) previously shown to be ATF3 transcriptional targets and genes encoding amino acid transporters (e.g., SLC1A4; Figure 3B). Importantly, although the gene set for serine biosynthetic process remained as the most enriched GO (Gene Ontology) term (Figure 3C), ATF3 regulated expression of all 3 genes (i.e., PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH) encoding the serine synthetic enzymes (Figures 3A and 3C). These unbiased data suggest that ATF3 likely promoted expression of SSP genes, thereby promoting serine biosynthesis to support cancer cell growth. Indeed, while serine deprivation caused rapid increases in the PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH mRNA levels in various cells, loss of ATF3 expression profoundly impaired the induction of all 3 SSP genes (Figure 3D). Moreover, serine-deprivation-induced increases in the PHGDH and PSAT1 protein levels were suppressed by ATF3 deficiency (Figure 3E). Note that ATF3 exhibited same effects in p53-null PC3 cells (Figures 3D and 3E), suggesting that these effects were likely p53 independent.

Serine deprivation induced expression of 609 genes while downregulating expression of 454 genes (Figure S3A; Table S1). The most enriched gene set induced by serine deprivation was that for the serine biosynthesis process, followed by the gene set involved in amino acid transport. Serine deprivation also significantly induced expression of ATF4 and its known targets, including ATF3, ASNS, and DDIT3:genes known to engage in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response (Figure S3B). Out of these genes, ATF3 appeared to be required for inducing 61 genes and repressing 23 genes (Figure 3B; Table S2), which include several genes (e.g., DDIT3, CHAC1, and GDF15) previously shown to be ATF3 transcriptional targets and genes encoding amino acid transporters (e.g., SLC1A4; Figure 3B). Importantly, although the gene set for serine biosynthetic process remained as the most enriched GO (Gene Ontology) term (Figure 3C), ATF3 regulated expression of all 3 genes (i.e., PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH) encoding the serine synthetic enzymes (Figures 3A and 3C). These unbiased data suggest that ATF3 likely promoted expression of SSP genes, thereby promoting serine biosynthesis to support cancer cell growth. Indeed, while serine deprivation caused rapid increases in the PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH mRNA levels in various cells, loss of ATF3 expression profoundly impaired the induction of all 3 SSP genes (Figure 3D). Moreover, serine-deprivation-induced increases in the PHGDH and PSAT1 protein levels were suppressed by ATF3 deficiency (Figure 3E). Note that ATF3 exhibited same effects in p53-null PC3 cells (Figures 3D and 3E), suggesting that these effects were likely p53 independent. To determine whether ATF3 regulates serine biosynthesis, we incubated the isogenic HCT116 cells differing in ATF3 expression in a medium containing [U-13C]-glucose for stable isotope tracing assays. While serine deprivation caused a dramatic increase in newly synthesized serine labeled with [13C] (the M+3 fraction), loss of ATF3 significantly suppressed serine synthesis induced by serine deprivation (Figure 3F). These results thus argue that ATF3 can promote cancer cell growth under serine-limiting conditions by inducing SSP gene expression and promoting serine biosynthesis.",

Interestingly, we re-analyzed our published ATF3 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data (GEO: GSE74363) and found that ATF3 had a very strong binding peak (hg19 chr1: 120,255,339-120,255,465) in the first intron of the PHGDH gene (Figures 5A and S5A), which overlapped with an ATF4-binding peak revealed by ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) (Figure 5A). The center of the peak contained a CARE site (5'-TGATGCAA-3'; Figure 5A) previously shown to be bound by ATF4 in A549 lung cancer cells. This earlier study also suggests that the intron 1 of PSAT1 contains a reverse CARE element (5'-TTGCATCA-3'; +249 to +257) that could be bound by ATF4. However, ATF3 did not appear to bind to this element but rather bind to a region (hg19 chr9: 80,912,032-80,912,156) close to the PSAT1 transcription start site and overlapping with an ENCODE ATF4 peak (Figures 5B and S5B). This region contained an AP-1 element (5'-TGACTCA-3'; Figure 5B). On the other hand, ATF3 bound strongly to a genomic region located in the PSPH intron 2 (hg19 chr7: 56,101,365-56,101,489) and containing a reverse CARE site (Figure S5C), while two inducible ATF3-binding peaks flanked the transcription start site of PSPH (Figure 5C). The intron 1 peak (hg19 chr7: 56,118,214-56,118,338) contained an AP-1 site (5'-TGAGTCA-3') and overlapped with an ENCODE ATF4 peak, although the promoter peak (chr7: 56,119,250-56,119,374) contained a CARE-like site (5'-TGATCAA-3'). We carried out ChIP-qPCR assays to determine whether ATF3 binds to these genomic regions in response to serine deprivation. Indeed, although the ATF3 antibody could pull down DNA fragments corresponding to these regions (Figures 5D-5F), serine deprivation dramatically increased the amount of bound ATF3 (Figures 5D-5F), suggesting that the metabolic stress induced by serine starvation promoted ATF3 to bind to SSP genes. As the ATF3 antibody did not pull down a non-specific DNA fragment localized in the PHGDH intron 4 (Figure 5G; marked as NS in Figure S5A) or precipitate DNA from the ATF3-KO cells (Figure 5H), it was unlikely that the detected ATF3 binding to these SSP gene regions was due to non-specific antibody binding. These results thus indicate that ATF3 also bound to SSP genes upon serine deprivation.",

Interestingly, p300 also appeared to regulate the serine synthesis pathway as the p300 inhibitor C646 inhibited SSP gene expression upon serine deprivation (Figure S6A), while the growth of p300-KO (p300KO) HCT116 cells was impaired in the serine-deprived medium (Figure S6B). We therefore tested a possibility that ATF3 recruits p300 to the promoters/enhancers of SSP genes to activate their expression. First, we carried out coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) assays and found that a FLAG antibody could co-precipitate ATF3 only in the presence of FLAG-tagged p300 (Figure 6A) and that a p300 antibody could pull down the endogenous ATF3 from cell lysates (Figure 6B).

To test whether the p300 recruitment is required for ATF3-mediated induction of SSP gene expression, we knocked out p300 expression from ATF3-WT and KO HCT116 cells (Figure 6G). Although ATF3 deficiency again impaired serine-deprivation-induced PHGDH and PSAT1 expression in p300-WT cells, such effects were largely compromised in absence of p300 (Figures 6H and 6I).

However, how PHGDH expression is regulated in cancer is not well understood. In TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) PanCancer Atlas Studies, PHGDH amplification was found in several types of human cancer (Figure 7A). Although higher PHGDH copy numbers correlated with higher mRNA levels (Figure 7B), the overall PHGDH amplification frequency was only 1.05% (Figure 7A), suggesting that a mechanism other than copy number variations might be responsible for the regulation of PHGDH expression in cancer. Because ATF3 could bind to the PHGDH enhancer and regulate its expression (Figure 5), we explored a possibility that ATF3 also contributes to the regulation of basal PHGDH expression in cancer. We thus retrieved ATF3 and PHGDH expression data from the TCGA PanCancer Studies for correlation analysis. Indeed, ATF3 expression positively correlated with PHGDH expression in several types of cancer, including testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs), adrenocortical carcinoma, breast-invasive carcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Figure 7C; p < 0.01). The correlation was particularly significant in GCTs (Figure 7C), a rare type of tumors that can be divided into nonseminomatous GCTs (NSGCTs) and seminomas. Interestingly, while NSGCTs grow and spread faster than seminomas, the PHGDH expression level was higher in NSGCT than that in seminomas (Figure 7D). As ATF3 was also highly expressed in NSGCT (Figure 7E), ATF3 might enhance PHGDH expression and promote serine biosynthesis, thereby contributing to the fast growth of this subtype of tumors. Note that no PHGDH amplification was found in testicular GCTs and adrenocortical carcinoma (Figure 7A). Moreover, although ATF4 expression also positively correlated with PHGDH expression (Table S3), such correlations appeared to be weaker than the correlations between ATF3 and PHGDH in these two types of tumors. The finding that the ATF3 expression level significantly correlates with that of PHGDH in breast cancer was also intriguing, as previous studies indicated that PHGDH expression and serine metabolism contribute to breast cancer progression and that ATF3 is frequently amplified in breast cancer and thought to promote breast cancer progression. Indeed, ATF3 was amplified in 7.64% of TCGA breast cancer samples (Figure S7A). However, neither ATF3 amplification nor copy number gains contributed to high ATF3 expression level (Figures S7B and S7C). These results thus suggest a strong possibility that ATF3 expression contributes to PHGDH overexpression, thereby promoting serine biosynthesis and cancer progression in a subset of cancers.",

Although higher PHGDH copy numbers correlated with higher mRNA levels (Figure 7B), the overall PHGDH amplification frequency was only 1.05% (Figure 7A), suggesting that a mechanism other than copy number variations might be responsible for the regulation of PHGDH expression in cancer. Because ATF3 could bind to the PHGDH enhancer and regulate its expression (Figure 5), we explored a possibility that ATF3 also contributes to the regulation of basal PHGDH expression in cancer. We thus retrieved ATF3 and PHGDH expression data from the TCGA PanCancer Studies for correlation analysis. Indeed, ATF3 expression positively correlated with PHGDH expression in several types of cancer, including testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs), adrenocortical carcinoma, breast-invasive carcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Figure 7C; p < 0.01). The correlation was particularly significant in GCTs (Figure 7C), a rare type of tumors that can be divided into nonseminomatous GCTs (NSGCTs) and seminomas. Interestingly, while NSGCTs grow and spread faster than seminomas, the PHGDH expression level was higher in NSGCT than that in seminomas (Figure 7D). As ATF3 was also highly expressed in NSGCT (Figure 7E), ATF3 might enhance PHGDH expression and promote serine biosynthesis, thereby contributing to the fast growth of this subtype of tumors. Note that no PHGDH amplification was found in testicular GCTs and adrenocortical carcinoma (Figure 7A). Moreover, although ATF4 expression also positively correlated with PHGDH expression (Table S3), such correlations appeared to be weaker than the correlations between ATF3 and PHGDH in these two types of tumors. The finding that the ATF3 expression level significantly correlates with that of PHGDH in breast cancer was also intriguing, as previous studies indicated that PHGDH expression and serine metabolism contribute to breast cancer progression and that ATF3 is frequently amplified in breast cancer and thought to promote breast cancer progression. Indeed, ATF3 was amplified in 7.64% of TCGA breast cancer samples (Figure S7A). However, neither ATF3 amplification nor copy number gains contributed to high ATF3 expression level (Figures S7B and S7C). These results thus suggest a strong possibility that ATF3 expression contributes to PHGDH overexpression, thereby promoting serine biosynthesis and cancer progression in a subset of cancers.",

Previously, ATF4 has been identified as the master transcription factor that directly binds to SSP genes to transactivate their expression in response to serine deprivation or oncogenic stress (e.g., Nrf2/MYCN expression). In this report, we presented data arguing for a notion that ATF3 is another crucial protein that can transactivate SSP genes and consequently promote serine biosynthesis and tumor growth under serine-restricted conditions. Our results support a model whereby ATF3 induced by ATF4 in turn binds to ATF4 to promote its activation, while ATF3 also recruits p300 to SSP genes for their transactivation (Figure 6J). Indeed, KO of ATF3 expression largely impaired expression of SSP genes upon serine deprivation (Figure 3) and suppressed serine biosynthesis and cancer growth under serine-deprived conditions (Figure 2). Given that ATF4 is an unstable protein and its induction is a transient event, ATF4-mediated induction of ATF3 could not only directly transactivate SSP genes but also stabilize ATF4 and thereby might serve as a positive feedback and fail-proof mechanism to ensure transcriptional activation of the serine biosynthesis pathway when the extracellular serine supply is limited or exhausted. This mechanism is distinct from the ATF4 self-limiting model whereby ATF3 induced by histidine deprivation rather antagonizes ATF4, thereby repressing expression of the asparagine synthetase (ASNS) gene. Although transcription of SSP genes might be regulated differently from ASNS expression, it is noteworthy that the ATF4 self-limiting model was primarily based on transient ASNS promoter-reporter assays. While transient ATF3 expression indeed caused a slight decrease in the PHGDH enhancer activity (Figure 5I), it can increase the activity of a promoter containing ATF3-binding sites in other reporter assays.

These results also suggest that p300 likely plays an important role in the regulation of serine synthesis pathway. Indeed, p300 inhibition impaired SSP expression induced by serine starvation (Figure S6A). Interestingly, an early study found that p300 can also interact with ATF4 and increase its stability. However, although ATF4 might similarly recruit p300 to SSP genes, we did not find that p300 increased the ATF4 level under serine-deprived conditions (Figures S6F and S6G). As loss of p300 did not completely abolish SSP expression induced by serine deprivation (Figures 6H and 6I), other transcriptional co-activators might involve in the regulation of SSP transcription as well. Indeed, ATF3 appeared to bind to the p300 paralog CBP as well (data not shown).",

ATF3 can form dimers with other bZIP-containing proteins, such as other ATF/CREB members. It is proposed that ATF3 homodimers repress while ATF3 heterodimers transactivate transcription. Consistent with an early report, although ATF3 could bind to ATF4, transient co-expression of ATF4 with ATF3 did not enhance PHGDH expression (data not shown). Rather, we found that ATF3 could bind to p300 and recruit p300 to SSP genes to enhance their expression (Figure 6).

Our current finding that ATF3 promoted the serine synthesis pathway thus warrants further investigations into the oncogenic activity of ATF3 in serine-restrictive environments, such as metastasis in the brain. On the other hand, ATF3 has established roles in the regulation of innate immunity. Whether therapeutic induction of ATF3 might repress anti-cancer immune responses thereby promoting tumor survival also warrants further investigations.",
