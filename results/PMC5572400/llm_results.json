            "text": "In the liver tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced signaling critically regulates the immune response of non-parenchymal cells as well as proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocytes via activation of the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways. Especially, the induction of negative feedback regulators, such as IkappaBalpha and A20 is responsible for the dynamic and time-restricted response of these important pathways. However, the precise mechanisms responsible for different TNF-induced phenotypes under physiological stimulation conditions are not completely understood so far. In addition, it is not known if varying TNF concentrations may differentially affect the desensitization properties of both pathways. By using computational modeling, we first showed that TNF-induced activation and downstream signaling is qualitatively comparable between primary mouse hepatocytes and immortalized hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. In order to define physiologically relevant TNF levels, which allow for an adjustable and dynamic NF-kappaB/JNK pathway response in parenchymal liver cells, a range of cytokine concentrations was defined that led to gradual pathway responses in HCC cells (1-5 ng/ml). Repeated stimulations with low (1 ng/ml), medium (2.5 ng/ml) and high (5 ng/ml) TNF amounts demonstrated that JNK signaling was still active at cytokine concentrations, which led to dampened NF-kappaB signaling illustrating differential pathway responsiveness depending on TNF input dynamics. SiRNA-mediated inhibition of the negative feedback regulator A20 (syn. TNFAIP3) or its overexpression did not significantly affect the NF-kappaB response. In contrast, A20 silencing increased the JNK response, while its overexpression dampened JNK phosphorylation. In addition, the A20 knockdown sensitized hepatocellular cells to TNF-induced cleavage and activity of the effector caspase-3. In conclusion, a mathematical model-based approach shows that the TNF-induced pathway responses are qualitatively comparable in primary and immortalized mouse hepatocytes. The cytokine amount defines the pathway responsiveness under repeated treatment conditions with NF-kappaB signaling being dampened 'earlier' than JNK. A20 appears to be the molecular switch discriminating between NF-kappaB and JNK signaling when stimulating with varying physiological cytokine concentrations.",

While IkappaBalpha binds and inactivates the NF-kappaB dimers containing the subunit p65, A20 terminates the pathway response upstream of the IKK complex and therefore affects both the NF-kappaB and JNK response (Ruland,). Remarkably, A20 contains both a deubiquitinase domain catalyzing K63 ubiquitin cleavage from RIPK1 and an E3 ubiquitin ligase domain facilitating K48 ubiquitin binding, which is associated with RIPK1 degradation (Ma and Malynn,). Depending on the cell type these feedback mechanisms efficiently desensitize the TNF-induced NF-kappaB axis for 60-100 min after stimulation with TNF (refractory range) (Ashall et al.,). Notably, recent data demonstrated that the refractory time is not static. Instead this phase represents an adjustable system, which is regulated in an A20-dependent manner with direct impact on the secretome of cells and the authors hypothesized that this dynamic system is part of an inherent mechanism controlling the cellular inflammatory response (Adamson et al.,). However, it is unclear if and how existing feedback mechanisms differentially affect the downstream effector pathways induced by TNF in order to induce adjustable NF-kappaB and JNK responses.",

This apoptosis in the absence of NF-kappaB depends on the persistent activation of the JNK axis followed by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Chen et al.,). Interestingly, previous experiments demonstrated that TNF activated NF-kappaB and JNK signaling with different dynamics (Iqbal and Zaidi,), suggesting the existence of intra-cellular decision making processes discriminating between cyto-protection via NF-kappaB and programmed cell death via JNK. However, the functional duality of this system is a matter of debate and precise mechanisms regulating hepatocellular cell fate are not well understood.",

The methodological assumption was that the model represented and integrated quantitative information from previous experiments. The ODE-based model was originally created to describe data from primary mouse hepatocytes after TNF stimulation (Pinna et al.,) and was extended and tested to qualitatively describe time-resolved, dynamic response of NF-kappaB signaling to various doses of TNF (Beuke et al.,). To confirm equivalence of processes in the different cell types it was required that the mathematical model could be adjusted to the observations in Hepa1-6 cells without changes in the model structure or to parameters describing biochemical properties of the molecules, such as Km values. Justifiable model adjustments were changes in expression levels or turnover rates of signaling compounds or changes in transcription or translation rates. Since the original model comprehensively described the known relevant processes in the canonical NF-kappaB pathway it was relatively large (28 variables, 49 reactions) and consequently its parameter values were not completely identifiable. Therefore, we worked with ensembles of model parameterizations that each describe the experimental data well and that allow the generation of predictions even without complete parameter identifiabilty (Beuke et al.,). The model simulations and parameter estimations were carried out in COPASI (Mendes et al.,).",

To test if immortalized murine HCC cells (Hepa1-6) can be used as functional model for non-malignantly transformed hepatocytes, we utilized a computational approach to compare the TNF-induced NF-kappaB and JNK pathway activation.",

In contrast, the total concentration of the TNFR1 was reduced in both HCC cells compared to non-malignantly transformed cells (median change: 2.5x). We then stimulated Hepa1-6 cells with TNF (10 ng/ml) and the total protein extracts were analyzed by quantitative Western immunoblotting for up to 480 min (12 time points; Figures 1B-D). As read-out, the activation of TNF downstream effectors, such as NF-kappaB (total p65, phospho-p65) and JNK (total JNK/phospho-JNK) was analyzed. In addition, the expression of the known negative feedback regulators IkappaBalpha (mRNA, protein, phosphorylation) and A20 (mRNA and total protein) was evaluated. For p65 and JNK an activation/phosphorylation with peaks around 5-10 min was detected in Hepa1-6 cells (Figures 1B,C). Total levels of IkappaBalpha showed an immediate decrease due to fast phosphorylation and concomitant proteasomal degradation followed by quick recovery to initial and higher concentrations (Figures 1B,C). A20 protein levels steadily increased 40-60 min after TNF stimulation until the end of the experiment (Figures 1C,D). In addition, real-time PCR results illustrated that the transcription of both feedback regulators was induced around 40 min after TNF administration, while the mRNA expression of other pathway constituents, such as p65 and IKKs was not affected (Figure 1E and data not shown). A similar dynamic pathway response was detected for another HCC cell line (Hep56, Supplementary Figure S1).",

Because no obvious differences between tumor cells and primary cells were detected in our experimental data sets, we hypothesized that adjustments of other pathway constituents can compensate the attenuated responsiveness upon TNFR1 reduction. The previously satisfying fit could be restored by applying simple parameter changes in the model either for the receptor dynamics (e.g., the internalization rate of the activated receptor complex; Figure 2, green lines) or at the level of IKK (e.g., IKK expression levels and IKK activation rate constants, data not shown). Other adjustments led to partial rescue of the dynamic pathway response (e.g., exclusive adjustment of IKK expression levels; Figure 2, blue lines). These results strongly suggested that hepatocellular (tumor) cells potentially harbor a number of adjustable setscrews, which may compensate for receptor variations. In addition, we drew the conclusion that most involved processes were qualitatively similar between hepatocytes and HCC cells.",

All cytokine concentrations induced specific phospho-p65 and phospho-JNK pathway responses, however, with concentration-dependent amplitudes (Figure 3). Even lowest TNF concentrations led to a sufficient expression of both negative feedback regulators IkappaBalpha and A20. Higher TNF concentrations (>5 ng/ml) did not further increase the NF-kappaB or JNK responses indicating pathway saturation (Beuke et al.,).",

In order to analyze the impact of TNF concentrations in the dynamic range between 1 and 5 ng/ml on this desensitization, a time-course experiment was designed, by which we combined multiple-pulse treatments with different doses of TNF (1 x 1 ng/ml; 3 x 1 ng/ml, 1 x 1 ng/ml followed by 2 x 2.5 ng/ml; 1 x 1 ng/ml followed by 2 x 5 ng/ml) (Figure 4). Cells were repeatedly stimulated with TNF after 60 and 120 min based on published data illustrating a restoration of pathway sensitivity after this time period (Ashall et al.,). As expected, a single TNF pulse induced a temporary activation of NF-kappaB and JNK signaling with comparable amplitude (Figure 4A). This first stimulation was sufficient to completely block p65 but not JNK phosphorylation after adding additional low doses of TNF (2 x 1 ng/ml; Figure 4B, arrows and arrowheads). Higher TNF concentrations (2 x 2.5 ng/ml) were able to partly overcome the refractory behavior and efficiently stimulated the phosphorylation of p65; however, the JNK response was always stronger after the second and third cytokine administration (Figure 4C, arrows and arrowheads). Lastly, repeated treatment with highest additional TNF concentrations (2 x 5 ng/ml) did not block the second phosphorylation of p65 but drastically dampened the third peak; however, a clear third induction of JNK was still detectable (Figure 4D, arrows and arrowheads). Importantly, identical results were obtained using another HCC cell line (Hep56, Supplementary Figure S2).",

            "text": "Because our previous data illustrated that TNF induced A20 protein expression after 40-60 min (Figure 1C), we decided to analyze the first 60 min after TNF administration to define the effects of basal A20 levels (without p65-induced A20 levels after 60 min). To test the impact of A20, we compared the activation of p65 and JNK after genetically changing the basal A20 levels in hepatocellular cells. Because the stable overexpression of A20 did not result in viable clones (Supplementary Figure S3A), we optimized the transfection protocol to achieve high transient transfection efficiencies of at least 80% (Supplementary Figures S3B,C). First, we transiently overexpressed murine A20 in Hepa1-6 cells and performed TNF stimulation experiments for up to 60 min (10 ng/ml; Figure 5A). While no significant effects on the phosphorylation of p65 were detectable, a reproducible reduction of JNK activation was observed (Figure 5B). Vice versa, the siRNA-mediated, specific inhibition of A20 again did not significantly affect the activation of p65. In contrast, JNK phosphorylation significantly increased in cells with transient silencing of A20. The fact that A20 did not affect p65 activity was confirmed in independent experiments including target gene expression and luciferase reporter assays (Supplementary Figures S4A,B). In order to further characterize the possible molecular basis for the differential impact of A20 on NF-kappaB and JNK, interaction studies were performed. Since ASK1 may sustain JNK activity and because A20 can interact with ASK1, we initiated co-immunoprecipitation experiments after TNF treatment (Tobiume et al.,; Won et al.,). Western immunoblotting revealed peculiar oscillatory dynamics between ASK1 and A20 with a maximum peak between 10 and 20 min after TNF stimulation (Figure 5C). Together with the published results, our data strongly suggested that the interaction between A20 and ASK1 is dynamically regulated by TNF and therefore might represent one possible mechanism how A20 controls JNK activity in the cell types analyzed here.",

Endogenous A20 and exogenous A20 were detected. Kinetics illustrate that NF-kappaB signaling is not affected after increasing A20 levels, while the phosphorylation of JNK is reduced after TNF administration (10 ng/ml). (B) The siRNA-mediated knockdown of A20 is confirmed by western immunoblotting. Kinetics after TNF administration (10 ng/ml) showed that JNK phosphorylation increased compared to controls. p65/phospho-p65 and JNK/phospho-JNK were quantified and normalized to the respective loading control (actin). All graphs summarize the results from three independent analyses. Bars represent standard errors. (C) Co-immunoprecipitation experiment detecting the physical interaction between A20 and ASK1 after TNF stimulation at indicated time points. The detection of ASK1 illustrates that the protein is not differentially expressed after TNF administration. IP: immunoprecipitation; WB: Western immunoblotting.",

In contrast, inhibition of A20 for 48 h and subsequent treatment with TNF induced cleavage of the effector caspase-3 around 120 min after cytokine administration as detected by Western immunoblotting (Figure 6B). Notably, this perturbation approach diminished both basal A20 levels and TNF-induced A20 levels (starting after 40-60 min). To confirm the negative effects of A20 on caspase-3, additional activity assays were performed after A20 perturbation for 48 h followed by TNF stimulation. As already indicated by caspase-3 cleavage experiments, caspase activity was significantly increased after reduction of A20 expression about 60 min after TNF treatment (Figure 6C). In contrast, no significant induction of apoptosis was detectable by FACS using an identical protocol (Supplementary Figure S5). This led us to the conclusion that the loss of A20 followed by TNF stimulation (and stabilization of the JNK pathway) is not sufficient to induce a full-blown apoptotic response, however, first steps toward apoptosis, such as activation of an effector caspase-3 may represent the molecular requirement for this process. These underlying mechanisms are currently under further investigation.",

For this, a precise and temporary paracrine cross talk between non-parenchymal (Kupffer cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and hepatic stellate cells) and parenchymal liver cells (hepatocytes) is of central importance to fine tune and adjust the cellular and biological responses in these cell types. In this context, TNF-induced signaling is a key constituent of the innate immune response. For this, TNF is immediately produced by non-parenchymal cells in the liver e.g., in response to circulating pathogens, such as bacterial toxins (Seki et al.,; Wu et al.,). Next to its immune-modulatory properties, TNF regulates proliferation and apoptosis in hepatocytes. However, it is unclear how varying individual and continuous TNF administration affect molecular decision-making process and hepatocyte biology.",

In addition, computational modeling focused on the subcellular localization of NF-kappaB (Turner et al.,), the role of feedback mechanisms relevant for pathway termination (Werner et al.,), and how cytokine concentrations affect the oscillatory pathway behavior (Wang et al.,). Recently, computational modeling demonstrated that TNF, which is secreted by Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), induced an adjustable molecular response in primary isolated hepatocytes (Beuke et al.,). This mathematical model was robust for many model parameters indicating that changes of pathway constituents, such as IkappaBalpha did not significantly change the NF-kappaB pathway properties. This is supported by data presented in our study illustrating that this model with only slight modifications sufficiently explain the dynamic NF-kappaB behavior in primary hepatocytes and HCC cells, although initial amounts of p65 and IkappaBalpha are different (Figure 1A). To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that TNF-induced NF-kappaB pathway dynamics is qualitatively comparable in normal cells and malignantly transformed cells.",

We hypothesized that A20 represents a molecular switch discriminating between the two pathways in a physiological concentration range. Our experimental data revealed that A20 negatively regulates pro-apoptotic JNK signaling and therefore favors the pro-survival NF-kappaB axis. Interestingly, increased A20 levels are detectable in human HCC tissue compared to surrounding livers, and recent publications confirm the oncogenic properties of elevated A20 levels (Chen et al.,; Catrysse et al.,; Wang et al.,). In addition, A20 inhibition followed by TNF stimulation supports caspase-3 cleavage and its enzymatic activity suggesting a phenotype prone to apoptosis. These results were confirmed by previous publications showing that increased A20 protects hepatocytes from TRAIL-induced apoptosis or supports hepatocyte proliferation after partial hepatectomy (Longo et al.,; Dong et al.,).",

However, under some conditions, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or after liver transplantation much higher TNF levels may be measurable (34.2 and 43 ng/ml, respectively). This suggests that under pathological conditions differential desensitization of NF-kappaB and JNK signaling upon TNF stimulation is not effective anymore (Krawczyk et al.,; Fernandez-Yunquera et al.,), since high TNF concentrations abolished any fine-tune regulation of both pathways (Figure 4). The biological relevance of precise cytokine concentrations has been confirmed in studies showing that different TNF amounts can cause distinct responses with regard to target gene expression (Ashall et al.,). Moreover, our recent computational multi-scale model illustrated that LPS-induced TNF levels between 0.1 and 5 ng/ml cause an adjustable NF-kappaB pathway response, while higher cytokine amounts show maximal pathway amplitudes (Beuke et al.,).",

The data suggest that repeated induction of low TNF amounts (between 1 and 2.5 ng/ml) can already lead to stronger pro-apoptotic JNK activation but less-pronounced pro-survival NF-kappaB signaling. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that inhibition of the JNK pathway in earliest phases of liver damage might prevent recurrent cycles of cell death followed by regenerative proliferation, which is one characteristic of e.g., chronic hepatitis C virus infection (Karidis et al.,). However, additional in vivo experiments would be necessary to definitely draw this conclusion. These could include CCL4-stimulation approaches in a liver-specific A20 knockout background (Lee et al.,; Liu et al.,).",

For example, A20 suppresses apoptotic JNK signaling in a TNF-dependent and independent manner via induction of ASK1 degradation (Won et al.,). Since A20 is efficiently induced by TNF administration it is tempting to speculate that the loss of ASK1 might shift the cellular response from apoptosis to survival and proliferation. Our data include an additional mechanistic level to this observation. ASK1 can phosphorylate JNK and the physical interaction between A20 and ASK1 has been demonstrated (Tobiume et al.,; Won et al.,). We here showed that TNF affects the interaction between A20 and ASK1, which could explain the ASK1-dependent phosphorylation of JNK at specific periods after TNF administration. The underlying molecular mechanism for this precise and dynamic fine-tune regulation is not understood, however, the natural oscillations observed in the activation dynamics of both JNK and NF-kappaB could be partly explained in terms of synchrony / asynchrony ASK1:A20 dynamics as observed in this study (Ashall et al.,).",

While single cytokine administration leads to temporary activation of p65 and JNK phosphorylation, the repeated stimulation with suboptimal (and physiological) TNF levels partly overcomes negative feedback regulation of JNK, while an effective inhibition of the NF-kappaB system is possible (Figure 4). These results reinforce the concept that different stimuli in space and time define cause different effects under physiological and/or pathophysiological conditions (Ashall et al.,). Our data suggest that A20 might represent one molecular switch how cells may discriminate between NF-kappaB and JNK signaling. This dynamic physical ASK1:A20 interaction might explain the oscillatory or sustained JNK activity and as a physiological consequence the switch between survival and apoptosis.",
