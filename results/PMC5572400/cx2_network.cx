                    "text": "In the liver tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced signaling critically regulates the immune response of non-parenchymal cells as well as proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocytes via activation of the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways. Especially, the induction of negative feedback regulators, such as IkappaBalpha and A20 is responsible for the dynamic and time-restricted response of these important pathways. However, the precise mechanisms responsible for different TNF-induced phenotypes under physiological stimulation conditions are not completely understood so far. In addition, it is not known if varying TNF concentrations may differentially affect the desensitization properties of both pathways. By using computational modeling, we first showed that TNF-induced activation and downstream signaling is qualitatively comparable between primary mouse hepatocytes and immortalized hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. In order to define physiologically relevant TNF levels, which allow for an adjustable and dynamic NF-kappaB/JNK pathway response in parenchymal liver cells, a range of cytokine concentrations was defined that led to gradual pathway responses in HCC cells (1-5 ng/ml). Repeated stimulations with low (1 ng/ml), medium (2.5 ng/ml) and high (5 ng/ml) TNF amounts demonstrated that JNK signaling was still active at cytokine concentrations, which led to dampened NF-kappaB signaling illustrating differential pathway responsiveness depending on TNF input dynamics. SiRNA-mediated inhibition of the negative feedback regulator A20 (syn. TNFAIP3) or its overexpression did not significantly affect the NF-kappaB response. In contrast, A20 silencing increased the JNK response, while its overexpression dampened JNK phosphorylation. In addition, the A20 knockdown sensitized hepatocellular cells to TNF-induced cleavage and activity of the effector caspase-3.

While IkappaBalpha binds and inactivates the NF-kappaB dimers containing the subunit p65, A20 terminates the pathway response upstream of the IKK complex and therefore affects both the NF-kappaB and JNK response (Ruland,). Remarkably, A20 contains both a deubiquitinase domain catalyzing K63 ubiquitin cleavage from RIPK1 and an E3 ubiquitin ligase domain facilitating K48 ubiquitin binding, which is associated with RIPK1 degradation (Ma and Malynn,). Depending on the cell type these feedback mechanisms efficiently desensitize the TNF-induced NF-kappaB axis for 60-100 min after stimulation with TNF (refractory range) (Ashall et al.,). Notably, recent data demonstrated that the refractory time is not static. Instead this phase represents an adjustable system, which is regulated in an A20-dependent manner with direct impact on the secretome of cells and the authors hypothesized that this dynamic system is part of an inherent mechanism controlling the cellular inflammatory response (Adamson et al.,).

To test the impact of A20, we compared the activation of p65 and JNK after genetically changing the basal A20 levels in hepatocellular cells. Because the stable overexpression of A20 did not result in viable clones (Supplementary Figure S3A), we optimized the transfection protocol to achieve high transient transfection efficiencies of at least 80% (Supplementary Figures S3B,C). First, we transiently overexpressed murine A20 in Hepa1-6 cells and performed TNF stimulation experiments for up to 60 min (10 ng/ml; Figure 5A). While no significant effects on the phosphorylation of p65 were detectable, a reproducible reduction of JNK activation was observed (Figure 5B). Vice versa, the siRNA-mediated, specific inhibition of A20 again did not significantly affect the activation of p65. In contrast, JNK phosphorylation significantly increased in cells with transient silencing of A20. The fact that A20 did not affect p65 activity was confirmed in independent experiments including target gene expression and luciferase reporter assays (Supplementary Figures S4A,B). In order to further characterize the possible molecular basis for the differential impact of A20 on NF-kappaB and JNK, interaction studies were performed. Since ASK1 may sustain JNK activity and because A20 can interact with ASK1, we initiated co-immunoprecipitation experiments after TNF treatment (Tobiume et al.,; Won et al.,). Western immunoblotting revealed peculiar oscillatory dynamics between ASK1 and A20 with a maximum peak between 10 and 20 min after TNF stimulation (Figure 5C). Together with the published results, our data strongly suggested that the interaction between A20 and ASK1 is dynamically regulated by TNF and therefore might represent one possible mechanism how A20 controls JNK activity in the cell types analyzed here.",
