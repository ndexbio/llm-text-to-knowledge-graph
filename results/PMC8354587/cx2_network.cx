                "description": "MicroRNA-1205 Regulation of FRYL in Prostate Cancer, High mortality rates of prostate cancer (PCa) are associated with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) due to the maintenance of androgen receptor (AR) signaling despite androgen deprivation therapies (ADTs). The 8q24 chromosomal locus is a region of very high PCa susceptibility that carries genetic variants associated with high risk of PCa incidence. This region also carries frequent amplifications of the PVT1 gene, a non-protein coding gene that encodes a cluster of microRNAs including, microRNA-1205 (miR-1205), which are largely understudied. Herein, we demonstrate that miR-1205 is underexpressed in PCa cells and tissues and suppresses CRPC tumors",

This region also carries frequent amplifications of the PVT1 gene, a non-protein coding gene that encodes a cluster of microRNAs including, microRNA-1205 (miR-1205), which are largely understudied. Herein, we demonstrate that miR-1205 is underexpressed in PCa cells and tissues and suppresses CRPC tumors in vivo. To characterize the molecular pathway, we identified and validated fry-like (FRYL) as a direct molecular target of miR-1205 and observed its overexpression in PCa cells and tissues. FRYL is predicted to regulate dendritic branching, which led to the investigation of FRYL in neuroendocrine PCa (NEPC). Resistance toward ADT leads to the progression of treatment related NEPC often characterized by PCa neuroendocrine differentiation (NED), however, this mechanism is poorly understood.

Although men diagnosed with local and regional PCa have 100% 5-years period survival rate, patients diagnosed with PCa at the distant stage have a relative 30% 5-years survival rate, indicating that the spread of the disease is extremely lethal. Although the androgen receptor (AR) is not the only driver of prostate carcinogenesis, almost 80-90% of prostate cancers are dependent on androgenic activity via AR signaling. Therefore, androgen deprivation therapy is critical for patients that display indications of high-risk localized or metastatic PCa and is currently the most effective treatment that significantly improves survival rates. However, 10-20% of patients develop castration resistant PCa (CRPC) due to failure of tumor regression upon treatment, in which 33% with CRPC develop metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) within 2 years of diagnosis. While several next generation hormone treatments, such as abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide, enhances survival rates for men diagnosed with mCRPC, approximately 20-40% of patients do not respond to treatments and those who initially respond to treatments may acquire secondary resistance. Moreover, as PCa is a very heterogeneous disease, some patients also acquire rare PCa subtypes after ADT relapse, such as neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), that are characterized as AR-negative and survive with complete independence of AR signaling. More recently, NEPC has been observed in 15-20% of patients with prostate adenocarcinoma who received chemotherapy, including treatments with abiraterone and enzalutamide. The transformation from prostate adenocarcinoma to NEPC as a consequence of androgen deprivation therapies is clinically termed treatment-related NEPC (t-NEPC). Although NEPC is rare (< 2% incidence in the United States), men who develop NEPC or t-NEPC have very poor prognosis because of lack of targeted therapies and insufficiently identified biomarkers. Resistance toward ADTs creates a new challenge for treating men with CRPC and better understanding of these mechanisms will provide knowledge on how to address PCa heterogeneity.",

Although NEPC is rare (< 2% incidence in the United States), men who develop NEPC or t-NEPC have very poor prognosis because of lack of targeted therapies and insufficiently identified biomarkers. Resistance toward ADTs creates a new challenge for treating men with CRPC and better understanding of these mechanisms will provide knowledge on how to address PCa heterogeneity.",

Although men diagnosed with local and regional PCa have 100% 5-years period survival rate, patients diagnosed with PCa at the distant stage have a relative 30% 5-years survival rate, indicating that the spread of the disease is extremely lethal. Although the androgen receptor (AR) is not the only driver of prostate carcinogenesis, almost 80-90% of prostate cancers are dependent on androgenic activity via AR signaling. Therefore, androgen deprivation therapy is critical for patients that display indications of high-risk localized or metastatic PCa and is currently the most effective treatment that significantly improves survival rates. However, 10-20% of patients develop castration resistant PCa (CRPC) due to failure of tumor regression upon treatment, in which 33% with CRPC develop metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) within 2 years of diagnosis. While several next generation hormone treatments, such as abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide, enhances survival rates for men diagnosed with mCRPC, approximately 20-40% of patients do not respond to treatments and those who initially respond to treatments may acquire secondary resistance. Moreover, as PCa is a very heterogeneous disease, some patients also acquire rare PCa subtypes after ADT relapse, such as neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), that are characterized as AR-negative and survive with complete independence of AR signaling. More recently, NEPC has been observed in 15-20% of patients with prostate adenocarcinoma who received chemotherapy, including treatments with abiraterone and enzalutamide. The transformation from prostate adenocarcinoma to NEPC as a consequence of androgen deprivation therapies is clinically termed treatment-related NEPC (t-NEPC).

One-way ANOVA analysis determined changes in the relative expression of miR-1205 between groups [F(2, 87) = 1.153]. A Tukey post hoc test revealed that miR-1205 expression was twofold lower in benign tissue (4.61 +- 7.5), and about threefold lower in PCa tissue (3.39 +- 3.53), when compared to normal prostatic tissue (6.55 +- 9.5) (Figure 1A).

An overall significant decrease of miR-1205 expression was observed in PCa cells when compared to normal epithelial RWPE-1 cells (Figure 1B). Interestingly, androgen-sensitive cells (WPE1-NA22, MDA PCa 2b, and LNCaP) displayed ~60% decrease in miR-1205 expression, whereas androgen-insensitive (PC-3, C4-2B and 22RV1) cells displayed ~80% reduction of miR-1205 expression in comparison to RWPE-1 cells. These observations suggest that miR-1205 may influence the phenotype and progression of aggressive PCa. Furthermore, underexpression of miR-1205 could indicate that it may have tumor suppressive functions that could drive PCa aggressiveness.",

To test our hypothesis, we induced NED in vitro and assessed the expression levels of miR-1205 and FRYL. NED was induced by culturing LNCaP cells in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS (androgen deprivation conditions). Cells were maintained in these conditions for fourteen days and expression levels of miR-1205, FRYL and NED markers (chromogranin A and NSE) along with morphological changes were observed via RT-qPCR, western blotting and light microscopy (Figure 6A and Supplementary Figure 5A). After LNCaP-NED was induced, we observed an overexpression of FRYL mRNA whereas miR-1205 was significantly underexpressed when compared to undifferentiated LNCaP cells, indicating a putative role of miR-1205 regulation of FRYL in PCa NED.",

We discovered that miR-1205 was underexpressed in histologically confirmed PCa tissue when compared to normal prostatic tissue. This underexpression was further observed among a large panel of PCa cell lines when compared to normal prostate epithelial cells. While miR-1205 does not affect cell proliferation of PCa cells, we discovered that overexpression of miR-1205 induces apoptosis and suppresses PCa tumor growth. We further describe the molecular actions of miR-1205 through regulation of its validated target, FRYL. FRYL is overexpressed in PCa tissues and aggressive PCa cell line models. Moreover, miR-1205 expression leads to the FRYL protein inhibition through direct targeting of the 3'UTR of FRYL. Lastly, we discovered that miR-1205 may be involved in neuroendocrine differentiation of androgen-dependent PCa cells, suggesting a role in aggressive PCa.",

A recent report by of the role of the miR-1205-EGLN3 axis in PCa suggests that there is somatic DNA amplification at the locus for PVT1-encoded miRs-1204-1208 and that this is correlated with miR-1205 overexpression in PC-3 cells. In this present study, however, when miR-1205 expression was examined using a panel of PCa cell lines, we discovered that miR-1205 is significantly underexpressed in PCa cell lines, when compared to normal prostate epithelial cells. Additionally, we observed that miR-1205 was underexpressed in PCa tissues, when compared to normal prostatic tissue, suggesting that loss of miR-1205 may be occurring during PCa tumorigenesis. While somatic amplification may occur at the locus for PVT1-encoded microRNAs, regulation at the promoter region was not investigated by. There is evidence that PVT1-encoded microRNAs do not share the same promoters and may be subjected to differential regulation. A closer look into the regulation at the promoter region of miR-1205 will further elucidate mechanisms of miR-1205 expression and action in PCa cells. Moreover, there is evidence that methyltransferases are important for the methylation of primary miRNA, allowing for recognition and processing by DGCR8 during miRNA biogenesis. Loss of certain methyltransferases can lead to reduced binding of primary miRNAs to DGCR8 leading to cessation of mature miRNA. Further studies into the upstream regulation of PVT1-encoded miRNAs, including miR-1205, could reveal insight on how miRNAs could be underexpressed in cancers. Nevertheless, we demonstrate for the first time that mature miR-1205 transcript are lower in PCa cells and that it's loss may contribute to cancer progression. There is now an abundance of evidence indicating that miRNAs can function as tumor suppressors and/or oncogenes, ultimately enhancing the progression of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, in-depth investigation on their potential role in cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatments are ongoing. MiRNAs are small molecules that can be found in biological fluids, such as urine and blood, whereby their detection and quantification of their expression levels can be used as biomarkers to link cancer incidence and progression.

As such, we were interested in discovering the clinical significance of miR-1205 in PCa to subsequently demonstrate its potential use as a novel therapeutic for treating aggressive PCa.

Fry has been studied in multiple models such as, Drosophila melanogaster, and plays a crucial role in multiple cellular processes including, dendritic branching during development, morphogenesis, cell division and cell polarization. Moreover, there is evidence that aurora A binds to the c-terminal region of the mammalian fry protein and induces phosphorylation to promote proper spindle formation during mitosis. However, it is unknown whether the FRYL protein shares these functions. Neuroendocrine cells located within the prostate epithelium have features of dendrite-like morphologies, which led us to investigate the role of FRYL in NED induced by ADT. By culturing LNCaP androgen-sensitive cells under androgen deprivation conditions, we observed a significant decrease in miR-1205 expression and an increase in FRYL RNA expression. Additionally, we observed that FRYL mRNA expression was significantly higher in CRPC and NEPC patient tumor samples, when compared to prostate benign tumors. These results led us to hypothesize that miR-1205 regulation of FRYL is involved in NED in aggressive PCa. Our data showed that overexpression of miR-1205 in androgen sensitive cells increased the expression levels of neuroendocrine markers (NSE and aurora A) and FRYL suggesting that miR-1205 regulation of FRYL may be involved in NED. However, when we investigated whether NED occurs directly through FRYL protein signaling, loss of FRYL did not induce changes in NSE expression and only induced a 20% decrease in aurora A expression, indicating that miR-1205 may not be regulating NED through FRYL regulation. However, further investigation is required. Fry and FRYL contain very similar structures within their c-terminal domains, which contains transcriptional activation properties. While loss of FRYL may not significantly affect the transcriptional regulation of aurora A, loss of aurora A could interfere with post-translational modifications within the c-terminal domain of FRYL that may overall contribute to regulation of NED. Therefore, further investigation into the phosphorylation profile of FRYL is needed.

Further investigation of miR-1205 in this mechanism may reveal novel insights on the progression of PCa.",
