Although men diagnosed with local and regional PCa have 100% 5-years period survival rate, patients diagnosed with PCa at the distant stage have a relative 30% 5-years survival rate, indicating that the spread of the disease is extremely lethal. Although the androgen receptor (AR) is not the only driver of prostate carcinogenesis, almost 80-90% of prostate cancers are dependent on androgenic activity via AR signaling. Therefore, androgen deprivation therapy is critical for patients that display indications of high-risk localized or metastatic PCa and is currently the most effective treatment that significantly improves survival rates. However, 10-20% of patients develop castration resistant PCa (CRPC) due to failure of tumor regression upon treatment, in which 33% with CRPC develop metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) within 2 years of diagnosis. While several next generation hormone treatments, such as abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide, enhances survival rates for men diagnosed with mCRPC, approximately 20-40% of patients do not respond to treatments and those who initially respond to treatments may acquire secondary resistance. Moreover, as PCa is a very heterogeneous disease, some patients also acquire rare PCa subtypes after ADT relapse, such as neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), that are characterized as AR-negative and survive with complete independence of AR signaling. More recently, NEPC has been observed in 15-20% of patients with prostate adenocarcinoma who received chemotherapy, including treatments with abiraterone and enzalutamide. The transformation from prostate adenocarcinoma to NEPC as a consequence of androgen deprivation therapies is clinically termed treatment-related NEPC (t-NEPC). Although NEPC is rare (< 2% incidence in the United States), men who develop NEPC or t-NEPC have very poor prognosis because of lack of targeted therapies and insufficiently identified biomarkers. Resistance toward ADTs creates a new challenge for treating men with CRPC and better understanding of these mechanisms will provide knowledge on how to address PCa heterogeneity."

While several next generation hormone treatments, such as abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide, enhances survival rates for men diagnosed with mCRPC, approximately 20-40% of patients do not respond to treatments and those who initially respond to treatments may acquire secondary resistance. Moreover, as PCa is a very heterogeneous disease, some patients also acquire rare PCa subtypes after ADT relapse, such as neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), that are characterized as AR-negative and survive with complete independence of AR signaling. More recently, NEPC has been observed in 15-20% of patients with prostate adenocarcinoma who received chemotherapy, including treatments with abiraterone and enzalutamide. The transformation from prostate adenocarcinoma to NEPC as a consequence of androgen deprivation therapies is clinically termed treatment-related NEPC (t-NEPC). Although NEPC is rare (< 2% incidence in the United States), men who develop NEPC or t-NEPC have very poor prognosis because of lack of targeted therapies and insufficiently identified biomarkers. Resistance toward ADTs creates a new challenge for treating men with CRPC and better understanding of these mechanisms will provide knowledge on how to address PCa heterogeneity."

It was previously reported that miR-1205 is expressed at very low levels among cancer cell lines (not including PCa cell lines), questioning its role in tumorigenesis. The aim of this study was to examine the role of miR-1205 in PCa. We observed underexpression of miR-1205 and overexpression of Fry-like (FRYL), a putative target of miR-1205, in PCa tissues and cell lines. Moreover, we generated novel synthetic analogs of miR-1205 and discovered that miR-1205 can inhibit castration-resistant prostate cancer growth in mice. Further investigation of miR-1205 tumor suppressive pathway confirmed direct miR-1205:FRYL binding and putative role of this pathway in PCa neuroendocrine differentiation (NED), a phenomenon occurring in resistant PCa subtypes."

Cells transfected with 7 nM of the miR-1205 or scramble biotinylated duplex were harvested and lysed after 24 h. The lysate and beads were mixed and incubated overnight at 4 C. The following day, beads were washed and target mRNA associated with the duplex was isolated using TRIzol (Ref:15596026, Thermo Fisher Scientific). To determine enrichment of target mRNA, qRT-PCR analysis were performed to detect FRYL in control (transfected with NB1) and experimental lysate (transfected with NB1205)."

One-way ANOVA analysis determined changes in the relative expression of miR-1205 between groups [F(2, 87) = 1.153]. A Tukey post hoc test revealed that miR-1205 expression was twofold lower in benign tissue (4.61 +- 7.5), and about threefold lower in PCa tissue (3.39 +- 3.53), when compared to normal prostatic tissue (6.55 +- 9.5) (Figure 1A). This data demonstrates that miR-1205 is underexpressed in human prostatic tumor tissue suggesting that loss of miR-1205 function may drive progression of solid prostatic tumors. To further verify the underexpression of miR-1205 in PCa, a panel of human PCa cell lines including RWPE-1 (normal prostate epithelial cells), WPE1-NA22 (RWPE-1 cells transformed with MNU; non-invasive), MDA-PCa-2b (PCa adenocarcinoma), PC-3 (small cell prostatic carcinoma), LNCaP (androgen-sensitive PCa adenocarcinoma), C4-2B (androgen-insensitive PCa adenocarcinoma), and 22RV1 (androgen-insensitive PCa adenocarcinoma) were used to asses mRNA expression. An overall significant decrease of miR-1205 expression was observed in PCa cells when compared to normal epithelial RWPE-1 cells (Figure 1B). Interestingly, androgen-sensitive cells (WPE1-NA22, MDA PCa 2b, and LNCaP) displayed ~60% decrease in miR-1205 expression, whereas androgen-insensitive (PC-3, C4-2B and 22RV1) cells displayed ~80% reduction of miR-1205 expression in comparison to RWPE-1 cells. These observations suggest that miR-1205 may influence the phenotype and progression of aggressive PCa. Furthermore, underexpression of miR-1205 could indicate that it may have tumor suppressive functions that could drive PCa aggressiveness."

A Tukey post hoc test revealed that miR-1205 expression was twofold lower in benign tissue (4.61 +- 7.5), and about threefold lower in PCa tissue (3.39 +- 3.53), when compared to normal prostatic tissue (6.55 +- 9.5) (Figure 1A). This data demonstrates that miR-1205 is underexpressed in human prostatic tumor tissue suggesting that loss of miR-1205 function may drive progression of solid prostatic tumors. To further verify the underexpression of miR-1205 in PCa, a panel of human PCa cell lines including RWPE-1 (normal prostate epithelial cells), WPE1-NA22 (RWPE-1 cells transformed with MNU; non-invasive), MDA-PCa-2b (PCa adenocarcinoma), PC-3 (small cell prostatic carcinoma), LNCaP (androgen-sensitive PCa adenocarcinoma), C4-2B (androgen-insensitive PCa adenocarcinoma), and 22RV1 (androgen-insensitive PCa adenocarcinoma) were used to asses mRNA expression. An overall significant decrease of miR-1205 expression was observed in PCa cells when compared to normal epithelial RWPE-1 cells (Figure 1B). Interestingly, androgen-sensitive cells (WPE1-NA22, MDA PCa 2b, and LNCaP) displayed ~60% decrease in miR-1205 expression, whereas androgen-insensitive (PC-3, C4-2B and 22RV1) cells displayed ~80% reduction of miR-1205 expression in comparison to RWPE-1 cells. These observations suggest that miR-1205 may influence the phenotype and progression of aggressive PCa. Furthermore, underexpression of miR-1205 could indicate that it may have tumor suppressive functions that could drive PCa aggressiveness."

A recent report by of the role of the miR-1205-EGLN3 axis in PCa suggests that there is somatic DNA amplification at the locus for PVT1-encoded miRs-1204-1208 and that this is correlated with miR-1205 overexpression in PC-3 cells. In this present study, however, when miR-1205 expression was examined using a panel of PCa cell lines, we discovered that miR-1205 is significantly underexpressed in PCa cell lines, when compared to normal prostate epithelial cells. Additionally, we observed that miR-1205 was underexpressed in PCa tissues, when compared to normal prostatic tissue, suggesting that loss of miR-1205 may be occurring during PCa tumorigenesis. While somatic amplification may occur at the locus for PVT1-encoded microRNAs, regulation at the promoter region was not investigated by. There is evidence that PVT1-encoded microRNAs do not share the same promoters and may be subjected to differential regulation. A closer look into the regulation at the promoter region of miR-1205 will further elucidate mechanisms of miR-1205 expression and action in PCa cells. Moreover, there is evidence that methyltransferases are important for the methylation of primary miRNA, allowing for recognition and processing by DGCR8 during miRNA biogenesis. Loss of certain methyltransferases can lead to reduced binding of primary miRNAs to DGCR8 leading to cessation of mature miRNA. Further studies into the upstream regulation of PVT1-encoded miRNAs, including miR-1205, could reveal insight on how miRNAs could be underexpressed in cancers. Nevertheless, we demonstrate for the first time that mature miR-1205 transcript are lower in PCa cells and that it's loss may contribute to cancer progression. There is now an abundance of evidence indicating that miRNAs can function as tumor suppressors and/or oncogenes, ultimately enhancing the progression of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, in-depth investigation on their potential role in cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatments are ongoing. MiRNAs are small molecules that can be found in biological fluids, such as urine and blood, whereby their detection and quantification of their expression levels can be used as biomarkers to link cancer incidence and progression. Moreover, with a proper delivery system, miRNAs can be used as inhibitors or mimics via anti-miR technology or replacement therapies, respectively, to treat cancers. As such, we were interested in discovering the clinical significance of miR-1205 in PCa to subsequently demonstrate its potential use as a novel therapeutic for treating aggressive PCa. In this study, we present the development of a novel tool and demonstrate its use for in vitro and in vivo techniques. A biotinylated synthetic analog of miR-1205 (NB1205) and a control biotinylated synthetic scramble duplex (NB1) was generated in effort to test our hypothesis that miR-1205 is a tumor suppressor.

                    "text": "MiRNAs comprise about 1-5% of the human genome, but regulates about 30% of protein coding genes. These small non-coding RNAs mediate mRNA gene silencing through RNA-interfering (RNAi) pathways. Partial binding to the 3'UTR of an mRNA results in translational inhibition, whereas extensive binding to a target mRNA results in degradation. Moreover, each miRNA can have an average of 200 mRNA targets, illustrating their importance in regulating multiple cellular processes. We were interested in the mechanisms involved in the tumor suppressor role of miR-1205 and therefore we examined the putative targets of miR-1205 where FRYL was identified and validated as a target of miR-1205. FRYL was first identified as a novel fusion partner of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene that was reported in patients who developed treatment-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The MLL gene has over 35 partner genes, which produce chimeric proteins containing the N-terminus of MLL and C-terminus of its fusion partner gene, such as FRYL. We established for the first time the overexpression FRYL mRNA and protein in PCa, CRPC, and NEPC cell lines and tissues, further implicating FRYL as a putative oncogenic factor in cancers such as PCa and ALL. Investigation of the MLL and FRYL fusion protein led to the discovery that the c-terminus of FRYL exhibits transcriptional activation properties, indicating that FRYL is a transcriptional activator. Therefore, it will be interesting to further investigate the role of FRYL as a transcription factor and its possibility to act as a fusion partner for genes involved in cancer progression."

                    "text": "Prostate cancer (PCa) was the second most diagnosed and deadliest cancer in 2020 with an estimate of 209,512 cases and 32,438 deaths in the United States according to GLOBOCAN2020. Although men diagnosed with local and regional PCa have 100% 5-years period survival rate, patients diagnosed with PCa at the distant stage have a relative 30% 5-years survival rate, indicating that the spread of the disease is extremely lethal. Although the androgen receptor (AR) is not the only driver of prostate carcinogenesis, almost 80-90% of prostate cancers are dependent on androgenic activity via AR signaling. Therefore, androgen deprivation therapy is critical for patients that display indications of high-risk localized or metastatic PCa and is currently the most effective treatment that significantly improves survival rates. However, 10-20% of patients develop castration resistant PCa (CRPC) due to failure of tumor regression upon treatment, in which 33% with CRPC develop metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) within 2 years of diagnosis. While several next generation hormone treatments, such as abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide, enhances survival rates for men diagnosed with mCRPC, approximately 20-40% of patients do not respond to treatments and those who initially respond to treatments may acquire secondary resistance. Moreover, as PCa is a very heterogeneous disease, some patients also acquire rare PCa subtypes after ADT relapse, such as neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), that are characterized as AR-negative and survive with complete independence of AR signaling. More recently, NEPC has been observed in 15-20% of patients with prostate adenocarcinoma who received chemotherapy, including treatments with abiraterone and enzalutamide. The transformation from prostate adenocarcinoma to NEPC as a consequence of androgen deprivation therapies is clinically termed treatment-related NEPC (t-NEPC). Although NEPC is rare (< 2% incidence in the United States), men who develop NEPC or t-NEPC have very poor prognosis because of lack of targeted therapies and insufficiently identified biomarkers. Resistance toward ADTs creates a new challenge for treating men with CRPC and better understanding of these mechanisms will provide knowledge on how to address PCa heterogeneity.",

The aim of this study was to examine the role of miR-1205 in PCa. We observed underexpression of miR-1205 and overexpression of Fry-like (FRYL), a putative target of miR-1205, in PCa tissues and cell lines. Moreover, we generated novel synthetic analogs of miR-1205 and discovered that miR-1205 can inhibit castration-resistant prostate cancer growth in mice. Further investigation of miR-1205 tumor suppressive pathway confirmed direct miR-1205:FRYL binding and putative role of this pathway in PCa neuroendocrine differentiation (NED), a phenomenon occurring in resistant PCa subtypes.",

One-way ANOVA analysis determined changes in the relative expression of miR-1205 between groups [F(2, 87) = 1.153].

Each target was screened using the galaxy web platform (see text footnote 1) for differential expression patterns in PCa. Consequently, Fry-like (FRYL) was identified as a putative target of miR-1205. Very little is known about FRYL, however, the c-terminus of FRYL is often observed to be fused to the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene associated with treatment related acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). FRYL has almost identical functional domains to the well characterized Fry protein, which functions as protein involved in many processes including cell polarization during morphogenesis, dendritic branching and tiling, spindle organization during division and gene expression. However, the function of FRYL as a target of miR-1205 has never been characterized, and FRYL's relevance in PCa remains unknown.",

                    "text": "It was previously reported that miR-1205 is expressed at very low levels among cancer cell lines (not including PCa cell lines), questioning its role in tumorigenesis. A recent report by of the role of the miR-1205-EGLN3 axis in PCa suggests that there is somatic DNA amplification at the locus for PVT1-encoded miRs-1204-1208 and that this is correlated with miR-1205 overexpression in PC-3 cells. In this present study, however, when miR-1205 expression was examined using a panel of PCa cell lines, we discovered that miR-1205 is significantly underexpressed in PCa cell lines, when compared to normal prostate epithelial cells. Additionally, we observed that miR-1205 was underexpressed in PCa tissues, when compared to normal prostatic tissue, suggesting that loss of miR-1205 may be occurring during PCa tumorigenesis. While somatic amplification may occur at the locus for PVT1-encoded microRNAs, regulation at the promoter region was not investigated by. There is evidence that PVT1-encoded microRNAs do not share the same promoters and may be subjected to differential regulation. A closer look into the regulation at the promoter region of miR-1205 will further elucidate mechanisms of miR-1205 expression and action in PCa cells. Moreover, there is evidence that methyltransferases are important for the methylation of primary miRNA, allowing for recognition and processing by DGCR8 during miRNA biogenesis. Loss of certain methyltransferases can lead to reduced binding of primary miRNAs to DGCR8 leading to cessation of mature miRNA. Further studies into the upstream regulation of PVT1-encoded miRNAs, including miR-1205, could reveal insight on how miRNAs could be underexpressed in cancers. Nevertheless, we demonstrate for the first time that mature miR-1205 transcript are lower in PCa cells and that it's loss may contribute to cancer progression. There is now an abundance of evidence indicating that miRNAs can function as tumor suppressors and/or oncogenes, ultimately enhancing the progression of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, in-depth investigation on their potential role in cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatments are ongoing. MiRNAs are small molecules that can be found in biological fluids, such as urine and blood, whereby their detection and quantification of their expression levels can be used as biomarkers to link cancer incidence and progression. Moreover, with a proper delivery system, miRNAs can be used as inhibitors or mimics via anti-miR technology or replacement therapies, respectively, to treat cancers. As such, we were interested in discovering the clinical significance of miR-1205 in PCa to subsequently demonstrate its potential use as a novel therapeutic for treating aggressive PCa. In this study, we present the development of a novel tool and demonstrate its use for in vitro and in vivo techniques. A biotinylated synthetic analog of miR-1205 (NB1205) and a control biotinylated synthetic scramble duplex (NB1) was generated in effort to test our hypothesis that miR-1205 is a tumor suppressor. Using this tool, we first showed that while miR-1205 does not regulate cell proliferation, it does induce apoptosis through caspase and PARP cleavage. Furthermore, we established that NB1205 suppressed tumors in in vivo CRPC model. Ultimately, this data suggests that miR-1205 has tumor suppressive functions by inducing apoptosis of aggressive PCa cells.",

In this present study, however, when miR-1205 expression was examined using a panel of PCa cell lines, we discovered that miR-1205 is significantly underexpressed in PCa cell lines, when compared to normal prostate epithelial cells. Additionally, we observed that miR-1205 was underexpressed in PCa tissues, when compared to normal prostatic tissue, suggesting that loss of miR-1205 may be occurring during PCa tumorigenesis. While somatic amplification may occur at the locus for PVT1-encoded microRNAs, regulation at the promoter region was not investigated by. There is evidence that PVT1-encoded microRNAs do not share the same promoters and may be subjected to differential regulation. A closer look into the regulation at the promoter region of miR-1205 will further elucidate mechanisms of miR-1205 expression and action in PCa cells. Moreover, there is evidence that methyltransferases are important for the methylation of primary miRNA, allowing for recognition and processing by DGCR8 during miRNA biogenesis.

Fry has been studied in multiple models such as, Drosophila melanogaster, and plays a crucial role in multiple cellular processes including, dendritic branching during development, morphogenesis, cell division and cell polarization. Moreover, there is evidence that aurora A binds to the c-terminal region of the mammalian fry protein and induces phosphorylation to promote proper spindle formation during mitosis. However, it is unknown whether the FRYL protein shares these functions. Neuroendocrine cells located within the prostate epithelium have features of dendrite-like morphologies, which led us to investigate the role of FRYL in NED induced by ADT. By culturing LNCaP androgen-sensitive cells under androgen deprivation conditions, we observed a significant decrease in miR-1205 expression and an increase in FRYL RNA expression. Additionally, we observed that FRYL mRNA expression was significantly higher in CRPC and NEPC patient tumor samples, when compared to prostate benign tumors. These results led us to hypothesize that miR-1205 regulation of FRYL is involved in NED in aggressive PCa. Our data showed that overexpression of miR-1205 in androgen sensitive cells increased the expression levels of neuroendocrine markers (NSE and aurora A) and FRYL suggesting that miR-1205 regulation of FRYL may be involved in NED. However, when we investigated whether NED occurs directly through FRYL protein signaling, loss of FRYL did not induce changes in NSE expression and only induced a 20% decrease in aurora A expression, indicating that miR-1205 may not be regulating NED through FRYL regulation. However, further investigation is required. Fry and FRYL contain very similar structures within their c-terminal domains, which contains transcriptional activation properties. While loss of FRYL may not significantly affect the transcriptional regulation of aurora A, loss of aurora A could interfere with post-translational modifications within the c-terminal domain of FRYL that may overall contribute to regulation of NED. Therefore, further investigation into the phosphorylation profile of FRYL is needed. Nevertheless, our data ultimately suggests that miR-1205 regulates NED and therefore, further investigation into miR-1205 targets may uncover novel mechanisms that drive NED.",
