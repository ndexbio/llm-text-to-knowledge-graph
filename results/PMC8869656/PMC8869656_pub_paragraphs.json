The global diabetic crisis has not abated despite the introduction of new types of drugs and targets. Persistent unaddressed patient needs remain a significant factor in the quest for new leads in routine studies. Drug discovery methods in this area have followed developments in the market, contributing to a recent rise in the number of molecules. Nevertheless, troubling developments and fresh challenges are still evident. Recently, metformin, the most widely used first-line drug for diabetes, was found to contain a carcinogenic contaminant known as N-nitroso dimethylamine (NDMA). Therefore, purity and toxicity are also a big challenge for drug discovery and development. Moreover, newer drug classes against SGLT-2 illustrate both progress and difficulties. The same was true previously in the case of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Furthermore, researchers must study the importance of mechanistic characteristics of novel compounds, as well as exposure-related hazardous aspects of current and newly identified protein targets, in order to identify new pharmacological molecules with improved selectivity and specificity."

        "text": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic progressive metabolic disorder in which the body is unable to utilize glucose. It could be caused by a decrease in pancreatic cell insulin secretion or a lack of insulin responsiveness in the body. Insulin aids glucose assimilation within cells, allowing blood glucose levels to remain within a healthy range (80-120 mg/dL). Thus, a deficit of insulin in the body results in hyperglycemia, raising the blood glucose level, which in turn leads to many metabolic and life-threatening complications, including cardiovascular, nephropathic, and neuropathic diseases, amongst others."

These factors contribute to inadequate diabetes screening and availability of preventive measures, as well as non-adherence to diabetes management guidelines once diagnosed.

The first reference to diabetes was in 1550 B.C. in an Egyptian papyrus, where it was described as a rare disease characterized by excessive weight loss and frequent urination. The term diabetes (to siphon or to pass through, in Greek) was first used by Apollonius of Memphis, who noted that patients with diabetes present with frequent urination. A Greek physician, Galen, hypothesized it to be a type of kidney disease, as the most prominent symptom was glucosuria. Avicenna (980-1037) offered a comprehensive description of diabetes mellitus in his publication \"The Canon of Medicine\" in 1025. Eventually, owing to its characteristic symptoms, many tests to more fully identify the disease were developed in the late 11th century, involving the examination of the subject's urine's color, odor and taste. The sweet taste of a diabetic patient's urine apparently led to its second name, mellitus (honey, in Latin). Later in the 19th century, Matthew Dobson discovered that the excessive amount of sugar in the urine of patients with diabetes gives it that sweet taste. He also provided an important distinction between the two different types of diabetes, which are now referred to as type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Banting and Macleod observed a reduction in blood glucose levels after administering islets of Langerhans to a pancreatectomized dog, and for this breakthrough discovery they were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1923. Eli Lilly acquired the first deal to produce insulin on a commercial level. Gradually, by the late 20th century, as the mechanisms behind diabetes started to unfold, various insulin preparations and other oral hypoglycemic drugs paved their way onto the market."

Earlier this was also called Non-insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM), but this term is no longer used because insulin is often used in the management of NIDDM. T2DM is believed to be caused by the gradual development of cells resistant towards insulin and beta-cell dysfunction, although the exact mechanism remains unclear. Being overweight or obese is a major risk factor for T2DM, as it may increase the likelihood of insulin resistance. This in turn will decrease uptake of glucose in, for example, the heart or musculoskeletal tissues, with simultaneous increase in glucose production in organs such as the liver. To counter this, insulin secretion is enhanced by beta-cells. Therefore, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia often coexist during early T2DM. In later stages of the disease, beta-cell function is also diminished. Thus, therapeutics that target beta-cell functioning and decrease insulin resistance are key treatments in T2DM. Some of the factors that control beta-cell functioning include oxidative stress, ER-stress and autophagy. Over the years, researchers have worked on various targets to moderate the onset or worsening of diabetes in their patients, out of which many turned into drug targets."

The non-sulfonylureas also stimulate beta-cells to secrete insulin, but they are short acting. In 2004, Jean-Claude Henquin proposed five potential action sites for insulin secretagogue beta-cell metabolism activation: increased blocking of beta-cell KATP channels; increase in intracellular (Ca2+) concentration by means other than KATP channels; activation of various amplifying pathways in beta-cells; action on beta-cell membrane receptors; and action on beta-cell nuclear receptors."

PTP1B dephosphorylates phosphor-tyrosine residues of insulin receptor kinase activation segments leading to negative regulation of insulin signaling. The evidence further suggests a relationship between PTP1B, insulin sensitivity, obesity and T2DM. PTP1B is also a negative regulator for leptin signaling. Leptin is a hormone primarily involved in maintaining metabolic homeostasis, and in obesity a decreased sensitivity to leptin results in the inability to attain satiety despite having good energy stores. PTP1B also plays an important part in pancreatic beta-cell proliferation. For example, Fernandez-Ruiz et al. found that that PTP1B knockout mice have a higher proliferation of beta-cells and elevated glucose-induced insulin secretion.

SLC16A11 knockdown in primary human hepatocytes leads to modulation of fatty acid and lipid metabolism. This modulation increases intracellular acylcarnitine, diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol levels which results in increased triglycerides in blood circulation and an accumulation in liver tissue. The increased levels of triglycerides are implicated in insulin resistance, so variants of SLC16A11 may increase the risk of diabetes by regulating lipid metabolism.

In addition, Fox01 in the pancreas are responsible for beta-cell dysfunction by inducing stress and apoptosis. Phosphorylation and acetylation are the two most common post translational modifications of FoxO1, where it regulates many gene functions. Phosphorylation of FoxO1 is the main mechanism by which it comes out of the nucleus to get degraded by ubiquitination. The acetylation state of FoxO1 depends upon the balance between the protein acetylases and deacetylases. Even FoxO1 gets activated by O-GlcNAcylation during oxidative stress-like conditions in diabetic livers and increases the activation of many gluconeogenic and ROS detoxifying genes. PGC1-alpha induction during fasting activates the series of gluconeogenesis genes and later directly binds to FoxO1 to phosphorylate and ultimately degrade it out of the nucleus."

FFAs are generally divided into three sub-categories based on their chain length as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) and long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). FFAs of these varying chain lengths are known to activate transmembrane receptors such as FFA1, FFA2, and FFA3. For example, FFA1 are expressed to a large extent on the pancreatic beta-cells and are activated by LCFAs. The activation of these receptors also plays an important role in the increase of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Therefore, because of its obvious role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, a series of FFA1 ligands have been identified and tested. FFA2 and FFA3 are akin to FFA1 receptors and get activated by SCFAs but their role in insulin is complex. FFA2 receptors are highly expressed in immune cells, especially neutrophils. Studies have also identified FFA2 expression on murine pancreatic beta-cell line MIN6 and isolated mouse islets. The indirect support for the role of FFA2 in diabetes comes from the fact that a fiber-rich diet is linked with a lower incidence of diabetes and SCFAs. Ligands for FFA2 are known to be produced by intestinal bacteria in the body by the fermentation of dietary fibers. Tang et al. showed FFA2 and FFA3 expression on human pancreatic beta-cells. These receptors are shown to inhibit insulin secretion by coupling to Gi-type G proteins. They also demonstrated that genetic deletion of FFA2 and FFA3 receptors in pancreatic beta-cells leads to higher insulin secretion in HFD animals, whereas similar deletion in intestinal cells did not affect glucose tolerance in diabetic animals. This study demonstrated that FFA2/FFA3 antagonists may prove beneficial in T2DM."

        "text": "Altered glucose and lipid metabolism are key factors associated with the development of NASH. Studies have shown the close relationship between metabolic disease and NASH. People having NASH are more insulin resistant than healthy people, irrespective of their weight. Although most of the patients with NASH are insulin resistant, they do not show hyperglycemia because of decreased ability of the liver to clear insulin. NASH patients only develop diabetes when pancreatic beta cells are unable to increase insulin secretion to match the insulin resistance."

        "text": "Some of the diabetic medications are used for the management and treatment of NASH. Glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors, which are used as second-line therapy for diabetes, have been used for amelioration of insulin resistance in NASH patients which ultimately improves the hepatic condition. The possible mechanism behind the improvement in insulin resistance is changes in body weight. However, researchers are still exploring the exact mechanism of these drugs. Dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors are another diabetic lowering class of agents that can be used for the treatment of NASH. Although these agents are not potent glucose-lowering agents due to their oral intake and low safety, these are used in combination with metformin in the management of diabetes. However, strong evidence is still missing for the clinical use of these agents for the management of NASH. Pioglitazone, an anti-diabetic drug, has been shown to improve the condition in 60% of NASH patients. SGLT2 can be used for the treatment of NASH as it is helpful in glucose homeostasis. It has been shown to reverse liver steatosis and hepatocytes necrosis. These agents have been shown to decrease the plasma aminotransferases resulting in weight reduction which ultimately improves liver steatosis. One of these agents has been found to improve beta cell functions and insulin metabolism. Insulin has been under research for the treatment of liver steatosis and improvement in NASH."

        "text": "Despite the helpful impacts of current glucose-lowering drugs, morbidity and mortality remain significant in T2DM patients, highlighting the need for the development of pharmacotherapeutics with a special focus on the many metabolic irregularities and different pathways associated with morbidity. Probably the best test in T2DM treatment is to avoid the drawn-out side effects of any therapeutic intervention, including nonalcoholic greasy liver infection/nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NAFLD/NASH) and CVD. Forthcoming investigations in T2DM have demonstrated a relationship between the level of hyperglycemia and the danger of micro- and macro-vascular inconveniences, including deadly CVD events. In any case, the new ACCORD and ADVANCE findings in patients with longstanding T2DM have demonstrated that aggressive glucose control in such patients has no reasonable advantages or may even increase the risk of CVD events. In this manner, other independent risk factors may exist that together contribute to CVD risk in these patients. On the other hand, such discoveries may essentially mirror the restrictions of current diabetic treatments, due to off-target impacts that counter the likely advantages of glucose-lowering agents. The discovery of SGLT2 inhibitors that seemingly have only a few drawbacks needs to be further studied. In phase-III clinical trials, vulvovaginal candidiasis and mycotic infections were the most common side effects seen in females. Osmotic diuresis is possible as glucose excreted in the urine also increases water and solute output, which can further lead to ketoacidosis or acidosis by hyperkaliemia and renal insufficiency. On average, SGLT2 inhibitors are expensive and difficult to continue for long-term use (, 15 September 2021). Currently, the search for new drug molecules that can activate sirtuins is of peak interest, and here resveratrol is considered the best characterized compound. However, it does not activate SIRT1 directly. Many similar molecular structures have been made of SRT1720 and SRT2104, which are active. Still, they need some substrate, and surprisingly they activate some fluorophore tags. They activate SIRT1 directly if endogenous sirtuin is similar to the fluorophore substrate (Figure 2)."

This welcome activity is geared toward greater understanding of the hidden systems of disease pathology and the advancement of a great number of potential therapeutics. Lamentably, sedentary lifestyles and uneven dietary preferences have contributed to the current obesity pandemic. Along these lines, there is a steadily developing need to improve prediabetes and diabetes treatment approaches. While therapeutic options have unquestionably advanced, the International Diabetes Federation reports that many patients with diabetes remain unable or unwilling to follow current clinical care guidelines."

It is important to the scientific community to focus on the factors that may be involved in those early stages of improvement to advance T2DM research. To these ends, various groups have already started enrolling cohorts of obese diabetic and non-diabetic patients in a gastric banding trial. Blood and tissue samples will be collected from these patients (and a complementary control arm) at the time of the surgical procedure and then longitudinally during a five-year follow-up. The clinical and laboratory findings from this and other ongoing trials will no doubt contribute to advancing our therapeutic approaches to the management of diabetes and other metabolic disorders (Table 4)."

        "text": "Trend Box   Diabetes mellitus is a complex metabolic disruption characterized by chronic hyperglycemia due to deficiencies in insulin production, its systemic release and action, and resistance.   Incident diabetes is also due to changes in performance of multiple key enzymes. Therefore, identifying and understanding key targets at structure-function-dynamics levels and their potential leads and/or drugs, shortcomings, and associated challenges all together can provide a roadmap for the discovery of new selective modulators.   We listed promising therapeutic targets for treatment of T2DM, most of them involving improvements in glucose tolerance.    Novel drugs from various targets have numerous locales of activity and each focus on a few components of the metabolic disorder. These may help pave the way for future type 2 diabetes treatments."
