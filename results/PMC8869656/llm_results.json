The global diabetic crisis has not abated despite the introduction of new types of drugs and targets. Persistent unaddressed patient needs remain a significant factor in the quest for new leads in routine studies. Drug discovery methods in this area have followed developments in the market, contributing to a recent rise in the number of molecules. Nevertheless, troubling developments and fresh challenges are still evident. Recently, metformin, the most widely used first-line drug for diabetes, was found to contain a carcinogenic contaminant known as N-nitroso dimethylamine (NDMA). Therefore, purity and toxicity are also a big challenge for drug discovery and development. Moreover, newer drug classes against SGLT-2 illustrate both progress and difficulties. The same was true previously in the case of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Furthermore, researchers must study the importance of mechanistic characteristics of novel compounds, as well as exposure-related hazardous aspects of current and newly identified protein targets, in order to identify new pharmacological molecules with improved selectivity and specificity.",

It could be caused by a decrease in pancreatic cell insulin secretion or a lack of insulin responsiveness in the body. Insulin aids glucose assimilation within cells, allowing blood glucose levels to remain within a healthy range (80-120 mg/dL). Thus, a deficit of insulin in the body results in hyperglycemia, raising the blood glucose level, which in turn leads to many metabolic and life-threatening complications, including cardiovascular, nephropathic, and neuropathic diseases, amongst others.",

The first reference to diabetes was in 1550 B.C. in an Egyptian papyrus, where it was described as a rare disease characterized by excessive weight loss and frequent urination. The term diabetes (to siphon or to pass through, in Greek) was first used by Apollonius of Memphis, who noted that patients with diabetes present with frequent urination. A Greek physician, Galen, hypothesized it to be a type of kidney disease, as the most prominent symptom was glucosuria. Avicenna (980-1037) offered a comprehensive description of diabetes mellitus in his publication \"The Canon of Medicine\" in 1025. Eventually, owing to its characteristic symptoms, many tests to more fully identify the disease were developed in the late 11th century, involving the examination of the subject's urine's color, odor and taste. The sweet taste of a diabetic patient's urine apparently led to its second name, mellitus (honey, in Latin). Later in the 19th century, Matthew Dobson discovered that the excessive amount of sugar in the urine of patients with diabetes gives it that sweet taste. He also provided an important distinction between the two different types of diabetes, which are now referred to as type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Banting and Macleod observed a reduction in blood glucose levels after administering islets of Langerhans to a pancreatectomized dog, and for this breakthrough discovery they were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1923. Eli Lilly acquired the first deal to produce insulin on a commercial level. Gradually, by the late 20th century, as the mechanisms behind diabetes started to unfold, various insulin preparations and other oral hypoglycemic drugs paved their way onto the market.",

Earlier this was also called Non-insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM), but this term is no longer used because insulin is often used in the management of NIDDM. T2DM is believed to be caused by the gradual development of cells resistant towards insulin and beta-cell dysfunction, although the exact mechanism remains unclear. Being overweight or obese is a major risk factor for T2DM, as it may increase the likelihood of insulin resistance. This in turn will decrease uptake of glucose in, for example, the heart or musculoskeletal tissues, with simultaneous increase in glucose production in organs such as the liver. To counter this, insulin secretion is enhanced by beta-cells. Therefore, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia often coexist during early T2DM. In later stages of the disease, beta-cell function is also diminished. Thus, therapeutics that target beta-cell functioning and decrease insulin resistance are key treatments in T2DM. Some of the factors that control beta-cell functioning include oxidative stress, ER-stress and autophagy. Over the years, researchers have worked on various targets to moderate the onset or worsening of diabetes in their patients, out of which many turned into drug targets.",

SU have shown good efficacy in reducing glycated hemoglobin microvasculature complications in patients with T2DM. However, their major drawback is prolonged binding time to the beta-cells, which results in prolonged insulin release. The non-sulfonylureas also stimulate beta-cells to secrete insulin, but they are short acting. In 2004, Jean-Claude Henquin proposed five potential action sites for insulin secretagogue beta-cell metabolism activation: increased blocking of beta-cell KATP channels; increase in intracellular (Ca2+) concentration by means other than KATP channels; activation of various amplifying pathways in beta-cells; action on beta-cell membrane receptors; and action on beta-cell nuclear receptors.",

Tyrosine phosphorylation in the insulin-receptor activation loop is an important step in insulin signal transduction. PTP1B dephosphorylates phosphor-tyrosine residues of insulin receptor kinase activation segments leading to negative regulation of insulin signaling. The evidence further suggests a relationship between PTP1B, insulin sensitivity, obesity and T2DM. PTP1B is also a negative regulator for leptin signaling. Leptin is a hormone primarily involved in maintaining metabolic homeostasis, and in obesity a decreased sensitivity to leptin results in the inability to attain satiety despite having good energy stores. PTP1B also plays an important part in pancreatic beta-cell proliferation. For example, Fernandez-Ruiz et al. found that that PTP1B knockout mice have a higher proliferation of beta-cells and elevated glucose-induced insulin secretion. These studies are strongly suggestive of the role of PTP1B in diabetes, and thus interest for PTP1B inhibitors, resulting in the search for and development of several inhibitors of this protein. Detailed descriptions of the reported PTP1B inhibitors can be found elsewhere.",

These diabetes-associated haplotypes caused a decrease in SLC16A11 expression in the liver and disrupted interaction with basigin, which reduced the cell surface localization of SLC16A11. SLC16A11 knockdown in primary human hepatocytes leads to modulation of fatty acid and lipid metabolism. This modulation increases intracellular acylcarnitine, diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol levels which results in increased triglycerides in blood circulation and an accumulation in liver tissue. The increased levels of triglycerides are implicated in insulin resistance, so variants of SLC16A11 may increase the risk of diabetes by regulating lipid metabolism. However, many questions remain unanswered, for example, what the unique substrates are that are associated with the transport of mediators targeting the physiological and biochemical mechanisms that affect T2DM.",

Martinerie et al. demonstrated that CCN3 deficiency in mice fed with standard high-fat diets markedly lowered their body weight, and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Moreover, Li et al. investigated the serum CCN3 levels in newly diagnosed T2DM (nT2DM) patients and compared it with healthy control subjects.

In addition, Fox01 in the pancreas are responsible for beta-cell dysfunction by inducing stress and apoptosis. Phosphorylation and acetylation are the two most common post translational modifications of FoxO1, where it regulates many gene functions. Phosphorylation of FoxO1 is the main mechanism by which it comes out of the nucleus to get degraded by ubiquitination. The acetylation state of FoxO1 depends upon the balance between the protein acetylases and deacetylases. Even FoxO1 gets activated by O-GlcNAcylation during oxidative stress-like conditions in diabetic livers and increases the activation of many gluconeogenic and ROS detoxifying genes. PGC1-alpha induction during fasting activates the series of gluconeogenesis genes and later directly binds to FoxO1 to phosphorylate and ultimately degrade it out of the nucleus.",

FFAs are generally divided into three sub-categories based on their chain length as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) and long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). FFAs of these varying chain lengths are known to activate transmembrane receptors such as FFA1, FFA2, and FFA3. For example, FFA1 are expressed to a large extent on the pancreatic beta-cells and are activated by LCFAs. The activation of these receptors also plays an important role in the increase of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Therefore, because of its obvious role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, a series of FFA1 ligands have been identified and tested. FFA2 and FFA3 are akin to FFA1 receptors and get activated by SCFAs but their role in insulin is complex. FFA2 receptors are highly expressed in immune cells, especially neutrophils. Studies have also identified FFA2 expression on murine pancreatic beta-cell line MIN6 and isolated mouse islets. The indirect support for the role of FFA2 in diabetes comes from the fact that a fiber-rich diet is linked with a lower incidence of diabetes and SCFAs. Ligands for FFA2 are known to be produced by intestinal bacteria in the body by the fermentation of dietary fibers. Tang et al. showed FFA2 and FFA3 expression on human pancreatic beta-cells. These receptors are shown to inhibit insulin secretion by coupling to Gi-type G proteins. They also demonstrated that genetic deletion of FFA2 and FFA3 receptors in pancreatic beta-cells leads to higher insulin secretion in HFD animals, whereas similar deletion in intestinal cells did not affect glucose tolerance in diabetic animals. This study demonstrated that FFA2/FFA3 antagonists may prove beneficial in T2DM.",

Originally, it was considered the positive regulator of adipogenesis with higher expression in adipose tissues, though it is also expressed in many other tissues and body cells of the body but to a lesser extent. It has been observed that specific deletion of PPAR  from different cell targets:such as adipose tissue, muscle, macrophages, and the brain:alters glucose homeostasis, which in turn reduces the activity of TZDs. PPAR  is well known for both promoting and secreting adiponectin which is considered an important insulin sensitizing hormone. It is a well-known transcription factor that regulates the functions of many genes both positively and negatively. However, fully understanding PPAR 's role and how it controls insulin sensitivity is still elusive. Despite many side effects, which include heart failure, weight gain, bladder cancer, plasma volume expansion, and others, it is still considered an important target. Understanding its mechanism and exploring its downstream pathway is of great interest. Epigenetic modifications or post translational modification in PPAR 's structure are thought to be promising routes in the treatment of various metabolic diseases. Various studies, including those on its phosphorylation at S273 or sumoylation at Lys107, have already demonstrated its importance in mediating insulin sensitizing actions.

Homodimerization and direct binding are associated with insulin resistance, affecting many gluconeogenic genes such as Pck1 and G6pc. Chronic activation of these receptors inhibits protein synthesis and favors proteolysis. This ultimately releases amino acids and acts as substrate for glucose production.

Due to its different roles in various diseases, it is predicted to be an important target in drug discovery. With concern to type 2 patients with diabetes, a significant difference was found in the genotypic and allelic frequencies of four SNPs of the NFE2L2 gene. In addition, one study involved induction of NRF2 in obese diabetic db/db mice, displaying a decreased blood glucose level by suppressing hepatic glucose 6 phosphatase via cAMP-CREB signaling. Leptin deficient mice showed decreased expression of NRF2 and displayed reduced amounts of white fat mass. This suggests that NRF2 is a key player in adipogenesis or in other metabolic disorders. It has been postulated that NRF2 levels can be increased with an acute dose of glucose, but chronic glucose conditions failed to activate it. Expression is also downregulated in prediabetes patients. NRF2-mediated protection is well defined in the dysfunction of diabetic retinopathy as well. NRF2 knockdown enhances the palmitate-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes of obese patients.",

It was thought that GLP-1 amide, which is the major circulation form in plasma, is the c-terminal metabolite which originates after the enzymatic cleavage of incretin hormone GLP-1 amide by dipeptidyl peptidase-4. These new metabolites also were considered to have an insulinomimetic activity that contributes to the pleiotropic effects of GLP1, other than its canonical GLP-1R. It has been found that direct administration of these metabolites has antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and proliferative effects on pancreatic beta-cells by modulating energy homeostasis. It has been reported that these metabolites preserve mitochondrial function, inhibit membrane depolarization and caspase activation and hence, apoptosis of INS-1 beta-cells. The effect of these metabolites on diabetes is further demonstrated by the administration of GLP-1 amide, which increases beta-cell mass and proliferation by activation of the cAMP/PKA signaling cascade and phosphorylation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.",

Probably the best test in T2DM treatment is to avoid the drawn-out side effects of any therapeutic intervention, including nonalcoholic greasy liver infection/nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NAFLD/NASH) and CVD. Forthcoming investigations in T2DM have demonstrated a relationship between the level of hyperglycemia and the danger of micro- and macro-vascular inconveniences, including deadly CVD events. In any case, the new ACCORD and ADVANCE findings in patients with longstanding T2DM have demonstrated that aggressive glucose control in such patients has no reasonable advantages or may even increase the risk of CVD events. In this manner, other independent risk factors may exist that together contribute to CVD risk in these patients. On the other hand, such discoveries may essentially mirror the restrictions of current diabetic treatments, due to off-target impacts that counter the likely advantages of glucose-lowering agents. The discovery of SGLT2 inhibitors that seemingly have only a few drawbacks needs to be further studied. In phase-III clinical trials, vulvovaginal candidiasis and mycotic infections were the most common side effects seen in females. Osmotic diuresis is possible as glucose excreted in the urine also increases water and solute output, which can further lead to ketoacidosis or acidosis by hyperkaliemia and renal insufficiency. On average, SGLT2 inhibitors are expensive and difficult to continue for long-term use (, 15 September 2021). Currently, the search for new drug molecules that can activate sirtuins is of peak interest, and here resveratrol is considered the best characterized compound. However, it does not activate SIRT1 directly. Many similar molecular structures have been made of SRT1720 and SRT2104, which are active. Still, they need some substrate, and surprisingly they activate some fluorophore tags. They activate SIRT1 directly if endogenous sirtuin is similar to the fluorophore substrate (Figure 2).",

            "text": "Trend Box   Diabetes mellitus is a complex metabolic disruption characterized by chronic hyperglycemia due to deficiencies in insulin production, its systemic release and action, and resistance.   Incident diabetes is also due to changes in performance of multiple key enzymes. Therefore, identifying and understanding key targets at structure-function-dynamics levels and their potential leads and/or drugs, shortcomings, and associated challenges all together can provide a roadmap for the discovery of new selective modulators.   We listed promising therapeutic targets for treatment of T2DM, most of them involving improvements in glucose tolerance.    Novel drugs from various targets have numerous locales of activity and each focus on a few components of the metabolic disorder. These may help pave the way for future type 2 diabetes treatments.",
