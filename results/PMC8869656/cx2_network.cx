                "description": "Exploring New Drug Targets for Type 2 Diabetes: Success, Challenges and Opportunities\n\nThere are substantial shortcomings in the drugs currently available for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The global diabetic crisis has not abated despite the introduction of new types of drugs and targets. Persistent unaddressed patient needs remain a significant factor in the quest for new leads in routine studies. Drug discovery methods in this area have followed developments in the market, contributing to a recent rise in the number of molecules. Nevertheless, troubling developments and fresh challenges are still evident. Recently, metformin, the most widely used first-line drug for diabetes, was found to contain a carcinogenic contaminant known as N-nitroso dimethylamine (NDMA). Therefore, purity and toxicity are also a big challenge for drug discovery and development. Moreover, newer drug classes against SGLT-2 illustrate both progress and difficulties. The same was true previously in the case of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Furthermore, researchers must study the importance of mechanistic characteristics of novel compounds, as well as exposure-related hazardous aspects of current and newly identified protein targets, in order to identify new pharmacological molecules with improved selectivity and specificity.",

Tyrosine phosphorylation in the insulin-receptor activation loop is an important step in insulin signal transduction. PTP1B dephosphorylates phosphor-tyrosine residues of insulin receptor kinase activation segments leading to negative regulation of insulin signaling. The evidence further suggests a relationship between PTP1B, insulin sensitivity, obesity and T2DM. PTP1B is also a negative regulator for leptin signaling. Leptin is a hormone primarily involved in maintaining metabolic homeostasis, and in obesity a decreased sensitivity to leptin results in the inability to attain satiety despite having good energy stores. PTP1B also plays an important part in pancreatic beta-cell proliferation. For example, Fernandez-Ruiz et al. found that that PTP1B knockout mice have a higher proliferation of beta-cells and elevated glucose-induced insulin secretion. These studies are strongly suggestive of the role of PTP1B in diabetes, and thus interest for PTP1B inhibitors, resulting in the search for and development of several inhibitors of this protein.

FFAs are generally divided into three sub-categories based on their chain length as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) and long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). FFAs of these varying chain lengths are known to activate transmembrane receptors such as FFA1, FFA2, and FFA3. For example, FFA1 are expressed to a large extent on the pancreatic beta-cells and are activated by LCFAs. The activation of these receptors also plays an important role in the increase of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Therefore, because of its obvious role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, a series of FFA1 ligands have been identified and tested. FFA2 and FFA3 are akin to FFA1 receptors and get activated by SCFAs but their role in insulin is complex. FFA2 receptors are highly expressed in immune cells, especially neutrophils. Studies have also identified FFA2 expression on murine pancreatic beta-cell line MIN6 and isolated mouse islets. The indirect support for the role of FFA2 in diabetes comes from the fact that a fiber-rich diet is linked with a lower incidence of diabetes and SCFAs. Ligands for FFA2 are known to be produced by intestinal bacteria in the body by the fermentation of dietary fibers. Tang et al. showed FFA2 and FFA3 expression on human pancreatic beta-cells. These receptors are shown to inhibit insulin secretion by coupling to Gi-type G proteins. They also demonstrated that genetic deletion of FFA2 and FFA3 receptors in pancreatic beta-cells leads to higher insulin secretion in HFD animals, whereas similar deletion in intestinal cells did not affect glucose tolerance in diabetic animals. This study demonstrated that FFA2/FFA3 antagonists may prove beneficial in T2DM.",

In general, glucocorticoids increase the blood glucose levels when required by the brain, but chronic activation of these receptors is associated with metabolic dysfunction, including insulin resistance. Glucocorticoids exhibit their effects either by directly acting on promoter or enhancer sites of the genes or by acting on other transcription factors and making a complex. Homodimerization and direct binding are associated with insulin resistance, affecting many gluconeogenic genes such as Pck1 and G6pc. Chronic activation of these receptors inhibits protein synthesis and favors proteolysis. This ultimately releases amino acids and acts as substrate for glucose production. While the precise mechanism for how these receptors regulate insulin resistance is still unknown, many studies show that GR activation inhibits insulin stimulated glucose uptake by controlling many downstream targets.",

Although these agents are not potent glucose-lowering agents due to their oral intake and low safety, these are used in combination with metformin in the management of diabetes. However, strong evidence is still missing for the clinical use of these agents for the management of NASH. Pioglitazone, an anti-diabetic drug, has been shown to improve the condition in 60% of NASH patients. SGLT2 can be used for the treatment of NASH as it is helpful in glucose homeostasis. It has been shown to reverse liver steatosis and hepatocytes necrosis. These agents have been shown to decrease the plasma aminotransferases resulting in weight reduction which ultimately improves liver steatosis. One of these agents has been found to improve beta cell functions and insulin metabolism. Insulin has been under research for the treatment of liver steatosis and improvement in NASH.",

Probably the best test in T2DM treatment is to avoid the drawn-out side effects of any therapeutic intervention, including nonalcoholic greasy liver infection/nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NAFLD/NASH) and CVD. Forthcoming investigations in T2DM have demonstrated a relationship between the level of hyperglycemia and the danger of micro- and macro-vascular inconveniences, including deadly CVD events. In any case, the new ACCORD and ADVANCE findings in patients with longstanding T2DM have demonstrated that aggressive glucose control in such patients has no reasonable advantages or may even increase the risk of CVD events. In this manner, other independent risk factors may exist that together contribute to CVD risk in these patients. On the other hand, such discoveries may essentially mirror the restrictions of current diabetic treatments, due to off-target impacts that counter the likely advantages of glucose-lowering agents. The discovery of SGLT2 inhibitors that seemingly have only a few drawbacks needs to be further studied. In phase-III clinical trials, vulvovaginal candidiasis and mycotic infections were the most common side effects seen in females. Osmotic diuresis is possible as glucose excreted in the urine also increases water and solute output, which can further lead to ketoacidosis or acidosis by hyperkaliemia and renal insufficiency.
