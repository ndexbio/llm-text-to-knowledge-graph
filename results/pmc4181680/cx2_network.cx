TNBC is typically observed in young AA women and Hispanic women who carry a mutation in the BRCA1 gene. TNBC is characterized by a distinct molecular profile, aggressive nature and lack of targeted therapies. The purpose of this article is to review the current and future novel signalling pathways as therapeutic approaches to TNBC. Recent Identification of a new BRCA1 trafficking pathway holds promise in the future for the development of targeted therapies for TNBC.",

Majority of the TNBC are the basal-like subtype, and many basal-like breast cancers are triple negative; they are not equivalent in terms of gene expression signatures and IHC analysis. Basal-like breast cancer is a classification based on gene expression profiling. Although they appear to be synonymous, there is up to 30% discordance between the two groups. In addition to low expression of ER, PR and HER2, basal-like breast cancers are characterized by a high expression of CK5, CK14, caveolin-1, caix, p63, EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)/HER1, which reflects on the mammary gland basal/myoepithelial cell component.",

The landmark study E2100 illustrated improvement in progressionfree survival (11.8 vs. 5.9 months, HR=0.60, p<0.001) when adding Bevacizumab to Paclitaxel chemotherapy compared with single-agent Paclitaxel alone in first-line treatment of metastatic disease. This subsequently led to subgroup analysis that demonstrated similar progression free survival benefits in both patients with TNBC and non-TNBC with the use of Bevacizumab plus a taxane. Currently, the BEATRICE trial is prospectively investigating this combination as adjuvant therapy in TNBC.
