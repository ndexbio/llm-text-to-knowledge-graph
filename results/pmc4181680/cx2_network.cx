Studies have consistently shown that more aggressive visceral and soft tissue relapses are more common and bone relapses less common among those diagnosed with triple negative versus ER positive disease. An estimated 15% of all patients with breast cancer will develop brain metastasis. In a series of over 3,000 patients with brain metastasis arising from breast cancer treated from 1989 to 2006, multivariate analysis indicated that triple negative status was the greatest risk factor for the development of cerebral metastasis (odds ratio=4.16; p<0.001), above that of HER2 positive status (OR=3.43; p=0.005). In another study using patients with BRCA1 mutation, there was 82% complete pathologic response in those treated with Cisplatinum alone.",

There are seminal studies by Hosey et al. and by our group (unpublished results) on the possible molecular mechanisms of BRCA1 dysfunction which could result in ER negative breast cancers. Recently Ubc9, a sole SUMO-E2-conjugating enzyme for sumoylation was found to bind BRCA1 proteins and ferry it to the nucleus unlike disease associated mutant BRCA1 proteins. Over expression of Ubc9 was observed in breast tumours and TNBC cell lines. BRCA1 function-based cellular assays have been designed to detect loss of binding to Ubc9 by BRCA1 mutants (Patent number US 8,372,580). These assays not only predict the risk for developing TNBC but may also lead to the development of targeted therapies for hereditary and sporadic TNBC.",

There are seminal studies by Hosey et al. and by our group (unpublished results) on the possible molecular mechanisms of BRCA1 dysfunction which could result in ER negative breast cancers. Recently Ubc9, a sole SUMO-E2-conjugating enzyme for sumoylation was found to bind BRCA1 proteins and ferry it to the nucleus unlike disease associated mutant BRCA1 proteins. Over expression of Ubc9 was observed in breast tumours and TNBC cell lines. BRCA1 function-based cellular assays have been designed to detect loss of binding to Ubc9 by BRCA1 mutants (Patent number US 8,372,580). These assays not only predict the risk for developing TNBC but may also lead to the development of targeted therapies for hereditary and sporadic TNBC."
