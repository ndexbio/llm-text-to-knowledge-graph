                "description": "Triple Negative Breast Cancer \u2013 An Overview\n\nTriple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease that based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) is estrogen receptor (ER) negative, progesterone receptor (PR) negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative. TNBC is typically observed in young AA women and Hispanic women who carry a mutation in the BRCA1 gene. TNBC is characterized by a distinct molecular profile, aggressive nature and lack of targeted therapies. The purpose of this article is to review the current and future novel signalling pathways as therapeutic approaches to TNBC. Recent Identification of a new BRCA1 trafficking pathway holds promise in the future for the development of targeted therapies for TNBC.",

                    "text": "In conclusion, TNBC is a difficult and complex disease entity that is both confusing and frustrating for researchers, physicians and patients. To date there are multiple approaches attempting to improve care of triple negative breast cancer patients, including DNA damaging agents like platinum's, targeted EGFR and VEGF inhibitors, and, PARP inhibitors; however, none have been as clinically successful as anticipated and more targeted therapies need to be developed and explored. The Wnt/b-Catenin, NOTCH and Hedgehog signaling pathways are being considered as novel therapeutic targets for TNBC.",
