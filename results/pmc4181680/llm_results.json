Majority of the TNBC are the basal-like subtype, and many basal-like breast cancers are triple negative; they are not equivalent in terms of gene expression signatures and IHC analysis. Basal-like breast cancer is a classification based on gene expression profiling. Although they appear to be synonymous, there is up to 30% discordance between the two groups. In addition to low expression of ER, PR and HER2, basal-like breast cancers are characterized by a high expression of CK5, CK14, caveolin-1, caix, p63, EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)/HER1, which reflects on the mammary gland basal/myoepithelial cell component.",

To combat this issue several neoadjuvant studies have been done which accentuated the relationship between chemo sensitivity and outcome, revealing proportionally higher sensitivity to anthracycline or anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy such as Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide (standard chemotherapeutic agents), for basal like/ER negative breast cancers as compared to the luminal subtype.

            "text": "The key to developing targeted therapies for TNBC will depend on understanding the molecular mechanism for the development of these cancers. There are seminal studies by Hosey et al. and by our group (unpublished results) on the possible molecular mechanisms of BRCA1 dysfunction which could result in ER negative breast cancers. Recently Ubc9, a sole SUMO-E2-conjugating enzyme for sumoylation was found to bind BRCA1 proteins and ferry it to the nucleus unlike disease associated mutant BRCA1 proteins. Over expression of Ubc9 was observed in breast tumours and TNBC cell lines. BRCA1 function-based cellular assays have been designed to detect loss of binding to Ubc9 by BRCA1 mutants (Patent number US 8,372,580). These assays not only predict the risk for developing TNBC but may also lead to the development of targeted therapies for hereditary and sporadic TNBC.",
