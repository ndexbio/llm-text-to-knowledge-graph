TNBC is typically observed in young AA women and Hispanic women who carry a mutation in the BRCA1 gene. TNBC is characterized by a distinct molecular profile, aggressive nature and lack of targeted therapies. The purpose of this article is to review the current and future novel signalling pathways as therapeutic approaches to TNBC. Recent Identification of a new BRCA1 trafficking pathway holds promise in the future for the development of targeted therapies for TNBC.",

Majority of the TNBC are the basal-like subtype, and many basal-like breast cancers are triple negative; they are not equivalent in terms of gene expression signatures and IHC analysis. Basal-like breast cancer is a classification based on gene expression profiling. Although they appear to be synonymous, there is up to 30% discordance between the two groups. In addition to low expression of ER, PR and HER2, basal-like breast cancers are characterized by a high expression of CK5, CK14, caveolin-1, caix, p63, EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)/HER1, which reflects on the mammary gland basal/myoepithelial cell component.",

Certain epidemiologic studies like the Carolina Breast Cancer Study illustrated that as compared to the luminal a tumours, basal-like tumours were more likely to arise among women with early menarche, higher parity, younger age at full term pregnancy, and shorter duration of breast feeding, higher body mass index, and higher waist to hip ratio, especially among pre-menopausal patients. Another study done by Bauer et al. found that younger, non-Hispanic black and Hispanic women diagnosed with TNBC, had tumours that were more aggressive, and these women had poorer survival regardless of stage. In addition, non-Hispanic black women with late stage TNBC had the poorest survival of any comparable group.",

Studies have consistently shown that more aggressive visceral and soft tissue relapses are more common and bone relapses less common among those diagnosed with triple negative versus ER positive disease. An estimated 15% of all patients with breast cancer will develop brain metastasis. In a series of over 3,000 patients with brain metastasis arising from breast cancer treated from 1989 to 2006, multivariate analysis indicated that triple negative status was the greatest risk factor for the development of cerebral metastasis (odds ratio=4.16; p<0.001), above that of HER2 positive status (OR=3.43; p=0.005). In another study using patients with BRCA1 mutation, there was 82% complete pathologic response in those treated with Cisplatinum alone.",

These patients have an extremely poor prognosis and relapse and die quickly. Several therapies are being developed that target specific biomarkers of TNBC or basal-like subtype. These strategies include EGFR-targeted agents, androgen receptor targeted agents, anti-antigenic agents, and PARP inhibitors are offering an option in triple negative disease; however, their uses as of date are limited to clinical trials and more work is needed to identify targets that yield high therapeutic ratios. TNBC with BRCA1 gene mutations may be more sensitive to agents that cause DNA damage, such as Cisplatin. Other, more recent promising therapeutic targets for TNBC include the NOTCH, Hedgehog and Wnt/b-Catenin signalling pathways. Studies have shown that these therapies alter the apoptotic pathway, inhibiting tumour progression.",

To combat this issue several neoadjuvant studies have been done which accentuated the relationship between chemo sensitivity and outcome, revealing proportionally higher sensitivity to anthracycline or anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy such as Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide (standard chemotherapeutic agents), for basal like/ER negative breast cancers as compared to the luminal subtype. Highest response rates were noticed among those classified as basal like (85%) and HER2 positive (70%), as compared to luminal (47%, p<0.0001). Despite initial chemo sensitivity, disease free survival (p=0.04) and overall survival (p=0.02) remained poorest among those with basal like and HER2 positive tumours, compared to the luminal subtype. Although triple negative disease is highly responsive to Anthracycline/Taxane chemotherapy treatment, a high risk of relapse still remains if the tumour is not completely eradicated.",

Several PARP inhibitors Olaparib, Velaparib and PF-01367338 are currently in clinical trials and hold a promising future. The study demonstrated a statistically significant 50% reduction in the risk of death; however, phase III trials failed to show statistically significant benefit for this combination, hence, the drug has been discontinued but some biomarker analysis is still underway to determine if a specific subset of patient may benefit from the drug.

This subsequently led to subgroup analysis that demonstrated similar progression free survival benefits in both patients with TNBC and non-TNBC with the use of Bevacizumab plus a taxane. Currently, the BEATRICE trial is prospectively investigating this combination as adjuvant therapy in TNBC.

There are seminal studies by Hosey et al. and by our group (unpublished results) on the possible molecular mechanisms of BRCA1 dysfunction which could result in ER negative breast cancers. Recently Ubc9, a sole SUMO-E2-conjugating enzyme for sumoylation was found to bind BRCA1 proteins and ferry it to the nucleus unlike disease associated mutant BRCA1 proteins. Over expression of Ubc9 was observed in breast tumours and TNBC cell lines. BRCA1 function-based cellular assays have been designed to detect loss of binding to Ubc9 by BRCA1 mutants (Patent number US 8,372,580). These assays not only predict the risk for developing TNBC but may also lead to the development of targeted therapies for hereditary and sporadic TNBC.",
