In this study, we show that Rin1 is expressed at high levels in a large number of non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, including Hop62, H650, HCC4006, HCC827, EKVX, HCC2935, and A549. Rin1 depletion from A549 cells resulted in a decrease in cell proliferation that was correlated to a decrease in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Expression of wild type Rin1 but not the Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factor-deficient Rin1 (Rin1A) complemented the Rin1 depletion effects, and overexpression of Rin1A had a dominant negative effect on cell proliferation. Rin1 depletion stabilized the cell surface levels of EGFR, suggesting that internalization was necessary for robust signaling in A549 cells. In support of this conclusion, introduction of either dominant negative Rab5 or dominant negative dynamin decreased A549 proliferation and EGFR signaling. These data demonstrate that proper internalization and endocytic trafficking are critical for EGFR-mediated signaling in A549 cells and suggest that up-regulation of Rin1 in A549 cell lines may contribute to their proliferative nature.",

In this study, we show that Rin1 is expressed at high levels in a large number of non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, including Hop62, H650, HCC4006, HCC827, EKVX, HCC2935, and A549. Rin1 depletion from A549 cells resulted in a decrease in cell proliferation that was correlated to a decrease in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Expression of wild type Rin1 but not the Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factor-deficient Rin1 (Rin1A) complemented the Rin1 depletion effects, and overexpression of Rin1A had a dominant negative effect on cell proliferation. Rin1 depletion stabilized the cell surface levels of EGFR, suggesting that internalization was necessary for robust signaling in A549 cells. In support of this conclusion, introduction of either dominant negative Rab5 or dominant negative dynamin decreased A549 proliferation and EGFR signaling. These data demonstrate that proper internalization and endocytic trafficking are critical for EGFR-mediated signaling in A549 cells and suggest that up-regulation of Rin1 in A549 cell lines may contribute to their proliferative nature.",

                    "text": "Rab5 cycles between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state, and Rab5 activation requires the exchange of GDP to GTP. This exchange is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that are specific to the Rab5 family of proteins. Rab5 family GEFs all contain a catalytic vacuolar protein sorting 9 (Vps9) domain that facilitates the GDP to GTP exchange. Many Rab5 GEFs contain other functional domains that are involved in cell signaling events. Rin1 is a good example of a multidomain Rab5 GEF. In addition to the Vps9 domain, Rin1 also contains an Src homology 2 domain, a proline-rich domain, and a Ras association domain. Rin1 was originally identified through its ability to interact with active Ras, and a role for Rin1 in a number of cell signaling systems has been established, including EGF-mediated signaling. Rin1 directly interacts with the activated EGFR through its Src homology 2 domain. Furthermore, Ras occupation of the Rin1 Ras association domain positively impacts the Rab5 GEF activity of Rin1, which promotes EGFR internalization and attenuation in fibroblasts. However, Rin1 expression is up-regulated in several types of cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and cervical cancer, through duplications or rearrangements of the RIN1 locus. These studies suggest that Rin1 may also play a role in enhancing cell proliferation.",

Rin1 expression is silenced by the transcription repressor Snail in several breast cancer cell lines. When Rin1 expression is up-regulated in these cell lines, transforming growth factor \u00df signaling is suppressed; cell growth in soft agar is inhibited, and breast cancer tumorigenesis is attenuated. These analyses and the data presented here strongly support the model that Rin1 can participate in the potentiation or attenuation of cell signaling processes through its modulation of endocytic trafficking events in a context-specific manner. Defining the impacts of Rin1 on receptor signaling and trafficking systems in different cell types has offered unique insights into how regulatory components of the endocytic pathway impact normal cellular functions and how these processes can be altered to enhance cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.",
