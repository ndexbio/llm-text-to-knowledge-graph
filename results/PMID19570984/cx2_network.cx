In this study, we show that Rin1 is expressed at high levels in a large number of non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, including Hop62, H650, HCC4006, HCC827, EKVX, HCC2935, and A549. Rin1 depletion from A549 cells resulted in a decrease in cell proliferation that was correlated to a decrease in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Expression of wild type Rin1 but not the Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factor-deficient Rin1 (Rin1\u25a1) complemented the Rin1 depletion effects, and overexpression of Rin1\u25a1 had a dominant negative effect on cell proliferation. Rin1 depletion stabilized the cell surface levels of EGFR, suggesting that internalization was necessary for robust signaling in A549 cells. In support of this conclusion, introduction of either dominant negative Rab5 or dominant negative dynamin decreased A549 proliferation and EGFR signaling. These data demonstrate that proper internalization and endocytic trafficking are critical for EGFR-mediated signaling in A549 cells and suggest that up-regulation of Rin1 in A549 cell lines may contribute to their proliferative nature.",

After 24 h of recovery, cells were re-plated, and the ability of these transformants to proliferate was determined using the colony formation assay. Although GFP-Rin1 re-expression levels were low, this construct complemented the proliferation defect associated with the Rin1 depletion, although at a reduced level; this partial complementation may be attributed to less than complete transfection efficiency. However, Rin1\u25a1 expression did not complement Rin1 knockdown defects but instead caused further inhibition of cell proliferation. These results suggest that a functional Vps9 domain is critical for Rin1 activity in EGFR-mediated cell proliferation. To verify that the Rin1 Vps9 domain was important for A549 cell proliferation, Rin1\u25a1 or wild type Rin1 expression constructs were transfected into A549 cells and assayed for colony formation. Only Rin1\u25a1 expression but not wild type Rin1 expression resulted in decreased cell proliferation.

When Rin1 expression is up-regulated in these cell lines, transforming growth factor \u03b2 signaling is suppressed; cell growth in soft agar is inhibited, and breast cancer tumorigenesis is attenuated. These analyses and the data presented here strongly support the model that Rin1 can participate in the potentiation or attenuation of cell signaling processes through its modulation of endocytic trafficking events in a context-specific manner. Defining the impacts of Rin1 on receptor signaling and trafficking systems in different cell types has offered unique insights into how regulatory components of the endocytic pathway impact normal cellular functions and how these processes can be altered to enhance cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.",
