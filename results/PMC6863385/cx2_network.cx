During a regular influenza season, about 90% of the deaths occur in people older than 65 years. Immune responses to vaccines are known to be particularly ineffective in the elderly population (>65 years of age), and yet some vaccines, such as those for influenza, are given primarily to the elderly. A major correlate of protection for vaccinations is the specific antibody titer generated by long-lived plasma B cells. With a lifespan of several decades, long-lived lymphocytes are particularly prone to accumulation of intracellular waste. Autophagy recycles unwanted cytoplasmic material. Autophagy-deficient lymphocytes are unable to generate adequate responses, in particular long-lived lymphocytes, memory T and B cells, and plasma B cells. Reversing immune aging would also open opportunities to improve management of age-related morbidities. However, little is known about how immune senescence can be reversed.",

Here, we first investigated the extent of the decrease across bone marrow progenitors and splenic mature hematopoietic cells, with a method of quantifying endogenous LC3-II, a marker for autophagosomes, using flow cytometry that we adapted for primary hematopoietic cells. To measure active autophagic flux, we used bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), which is a lysosomal V-ATPase inhibitor that prevents acidification of lysosomes and their degradative functions, thereby causing accumulation of autophagic substrates, including LC3-II (Figure 1A). Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were found to have the highest basal autophagy levels compared with other hematopoietic cells. Although their autophagic flux was mildly reduced in old mice, it was significantly decreased in B and T cells from old mice as compared to young mice (Figure 1A; gating strategy in Figures S1A and S1B). Treatment of mice for 6 weeks with spermidine increased autophagic flux in most hematopoietic cell types tested (Figure 1A). We then tested if the in vivo administration of spermidine alleviates typical hallmarks of hematopoietic aging, including expansion of phenotypic HSCs, myeloproliferation, and lymphopenia. We observed a significant increase of phenotypic HSCs and Lin-Sca1+cKit+ cells (LSKs) in old mice, which spermidine administration did not affect (Figures 1B and S1C). A myeloid-biased phenotype, including increased myeloid cells and more significantly diminished mature B and T cells, was found in spleens of old mice (Figures 1C and S1D). Consistently, multiple bone marrow myeloid progenitors are expanded (Figures 1D, S1E, and S1F). Bone marrow pro-B cells (CD43+) also mildly accumulate (Figures 1E, 1F, S1G, and S1H), in line with the paradigm that pro-B cell maturation is blocked with age.

TFEB is a key transcription factor regulating autophagosomal and lysosomal biogenesis. The effect of inhibition of eIF5A hypusination by GC7 on overall and nuclear TFEB was confirmed by western blot in activated primary B cells (Figures 4C and 4D). Accordingly, gene expression of several TFEB targets was markedly decreased upon GC7 treatment. Genetic KD of Tfeb was sufficient to reduce autophagic flux in NIH 3T3 cells (Figures 4F and S5D), as reported.

Genetic KD of Tfeb was sufficient to reduce autophagic flux in NIH 3T3 cells (Figures 4F and S5D), as reported. KD of Eif5a and Dhs, or GC7 treatment in NIH 3T3 cells, led to a decrease in TFEB protein (Figures 4G and 4H). To test if TFEB is affected by spermidine depletion, we inhibited spermidine synthesis in NIH 3T3 cells by siOdc or DFMO.

We first investigated if eIF5A controls overall protein synthesis in lymphocytes, as previously reported. We measured translation by flow cytometry with O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP) and found that inhibition of eIF5A hypusination by GC7 caused a 30% reduction in protein synthesis rate in activated primary B cells (Figure 5A). A similar reduction was observed using a puromycin-independent assay with L-azidohomoalanine (AHA; a methionine analog) incorporation (Figure S5J). To further assess translational changes caused by GC7, we performed ribosome profiling in activated primary B cells. Increased ribosome occupancy at the start codon was observed by GC7 treatment (Figure S5K). However, whether the accumulation of reads at the start codon is an artifact of cycloheximide treatment during sample preparation will require further validation. Stalling of ribosomes at the triproline-encoding motif (PPP) was found in activated primary B cells (Figure S5L), as observed in yeast and bacteria, indicating that polyproline is a conserved ribosome-pausing motif across kingdoms.

By pulling down nascent proteins after 4 h of AHA labeling, a significant reduction of nascent TFEB was observed (Figures 5B and S5N). Interestingly, nascent eIF5A was also mildly reduced, suggesting an auto-regulatory loop of eIF5A at the translational level (Figures 5B and S5N). This is not reflected in overall eIF5A levels, probably because of the short treatment and the long half-life of eIF5A. Both human and mouse TFEB have at least one triproline motif (Figure 5C). Indeed, sequences around this triproline are also ribosome-pausing motifs (SPP and PPV), suggesting that this triproline-containing motif may confer TFEB with the specific requirement to rely on eIF5A for smooth translation. Therefore, we examined if the triproline motif in murine and human TFEB is sufficient to affect translation rate as regulated by hypusinated eIF5A. We generated three different constructs, using labile mCherry expression to report on the synthesis of either the TFEB triproline-containing motif, 13 consecutive prolines (13Pro), or a random sequence (Figure 5C). After transfection into NIH 3T3 cells, we measured translation using the ratio of the reporter mCherry to the transfection control GFP. As expected, the mCherry/GFP ratio was mildly reduced by GC7 for the random sequence and reduced by nearly half for the 13Pro motif, while the synthesis of TFEB triproline motif was also significantly inhibited (Figure 5D), indicating that the TFEB triproline motif requires hypusinated eIF5A for efficient synthesis. Moreover, mutating the triproline motif (PPP to AAA) partially rescued the expression of TFEB in the absence of hypusinated eIF5A (Figure 5E), indicating that the triproline motif is one, but not the only mechanism accounting for GC7-induced TFEB reduction. Overexpression of the triproline-mutated TFEB induced autophagy to a similar extent as wild-type TFEB (Figure 5F). However, when the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) was mutated in addition to triprolines, autophagy induction was lost. Taken together this indicates that the polyproline mutation does not compromise the function of TFEB as a transcription factor. Moreover, overexpressing mutant TFEB was sufficient to rescue autophagy in GC7-treated cells (Figure 5G), indicating that TFEB is critical for eIF5A-regulated autophagy. These data suggest that hypusinated eIF5A directly facilitates the synthesis of TFEB partially via the triproline-containing motif.

To investigate the function of hypusinated eIF5A during B cell development and activation in vivo, we generated competitive mixed bone marrow chimeras with inducible deletion of the hypusinating enzyme DHS. Dhs deletion was induced after long-term engraftment and B cell lineage reconstitution of CD45.2+ cells was examined on days 8 and 30 after deletion (Figure S6A). Percentages of CD45.2+ of both transitional and mature circulating B cells in peripheral blood were significantly affected by Dhs deletion on day 30 (Figures S6B and S6C). Upon sacrifice of the mice on day 34, we investigated if this was due to a loss of progenitors in the bone marrow. Unexpectedly, all multipotent hematopoietic progenitors investigated (HSC, MPP, LMPP, and LSK) were severely affected by DHS depletion (Figure S6D). This is in line with a bone marrow hypocellularity reported previously in whole-body Dhs-KO mice. Consistent with depleted HSCs, splenic CD45.2+ myeloid cells, which mostly lack self-renewal capacity and rely on replenishment from progenitor cells, were also severely depleted after Dhs deletion (Figure S6E). Similarly, early B cell progenitors (pre-pro B cells), newly formed B cells and mature B cells from bone marrow as well as splenic transitional, marginal zone and follicular B cells were found significantly diminished (Figures S6F-S6H). The reduced B cell progenitors may result from either loss of HSCs or intrinsic survival defects. We checked if the remaining CD45.2+ cells were indeed deleted for Dhs in blood (Figure S6I), bone marrow, and spleen (Figure S6J). This analysis revealed that although on day 8 after deletion with tamoxifen, blood cells were adequately deleted in the floxed Dhs mice, in cells that survived to day 34, Dhs was not deleted in most mice (Figure S6J).

As before, after 3 weeks of deletion, all remaining lymphocytes expressed wild-type Dhs only. Levels of NP-specific IgG1 post-boost were not significantly changed in KO mice (data not shown), which can be attributed to contamination from non-deleted memory B cells. Overall the data imply that complete inhibition of eIF5A hypusination kills hematopoietic cells, and its effect on generation of antibodies cannot easily be investigated in vivo, because of (1) the rapid elimination of cells knocked out for Dhs and (2) the limiting deletion efficiency in mature B cells with inducible deletion models.",

Although acute autophagy induction may not require gene expression and protein synthesis, with components being readily available, long-term autophagic flux does depend on continued gene expression. We identified one specific mechanism of this regulation, whereby the polyamine metabolite spermidine is a substrate for the hypusination of the translation factor eIF5A, which in turn controls the synthesis of TFEB protein. This mechanism operates normally in the young, in whom spermidine is abundant. In B cells from old individuals, however, replenishing spermidine levels restored this pathway, thereby boosting responses in vivo in mice and ex vivo in humans. Depleted spermidine levels and subsequent low TFEB expression may be an important cause of the reduction in autophagy in the aging adaptive immune system, as well as in other tissues. However, other potential direct or indirect mechanisms may play a role in the anti-aging effects of polyamines, such as epigenetic modifications or changes in metabolism.",

In this loop, autophagy provides substrates and energy for increased translation, while inducing the synthesis of certain autophagic proteins such as TFEB.
