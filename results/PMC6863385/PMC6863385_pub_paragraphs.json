Here we show that reduced autophagy is a central molecular mechanism underlying immune senescence. Autophagy levels are specifically reduced in mature lymphocytes, leading to compromised memory B cell responses in old individuals. Spermidine, an endogenous polyamine metabolite, induces autophagy in vivo and rejuvenates memory B cell responses. Mechanistically, spermidine post-translationally modifies the translation factor eIF5A, which is essential for the synthesis of the autophagy transcription factor TFEB. Spermidine is depleted in the elderly, leading to reduced TFEB expression and autophagy. Spermidine supplementation restored this pathway and improved the responses of old human B cells. Taken together, our results reveal an unexpected autophagy regulatory mechanism mediated by eIF5A at the translational level, which can be harnessed to reverse immune senescence in humans."

        "text": "Immune senescence is characterized by the failure of lymphocytes to respond adequately to infection, malignancy, and vaccination. During a regular influenza season, about 90% of the deaths occur in people older than 65 years. Immune responses to vaccines are known to be particularly ineffective in the elderly population (>65 years of age), and yet some vaccines, such as those for influenza, are given primarily to the elderly. A major correlate of protection for vaccinations is the specific antibody titer generated by long-lived plasma B cells. With a lifespan of several decades, long-lived lymphocytes are particularly prone to accumulation of intracellular waste. Autophagy recycles unwanted cytoplasmic material. Autophagy-deficient lymphocytes are unable to generate adequate responses, in particular long-lived lymphocytes, memory T and B cells, and plasma B cells. Reversing immune aging would also open opportunities to improve management of age-related morbidities. However, little is known about how immune senescence can be reversed."

        "text": "Genetic activation of autophagy extends lifespan in mice. However, only a few autophagy-inducing drugs reverse aging, one being rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR. Because of the unwanted effects of mTOR inhibition, there is a need to better understand mTOR-independent control of autophagy for drug development. Furthermore, to test anti-aging drugs, blood biomarkers are critical. As an endogenous polyamine metabolite that declines with age, spermidine may be key in controlling cellular aging via autophagy. Previously we found in aged mice that spermidine improves memory T cell responses, and showed cardiac function was restored with spermidine, both in an autophagy-dependent manner. Here we investigated whether spermidine is able to rejuvenate long-term B cell responses, the main correlate of protection for vaccination. We found an autophagy-dependent improvement of B cell responses by spermidine in old mice, indicating an effect across different immune cell types. We further identified the mechanism by which it regulates autophagy. Spermidine post-translationally modifies (hypusinates) eIF5A, which regulates protein synthesis and autophagy in primary B cells. Because of the rigid structure of proline, triprolines slow down translation and require hypusinated eIF5A to form peptide bonds more effectively. We find that this is specifically required for the synthesis of the autophagosomal and lysosomal master regulator TFEB, which is a short-lived protein containing one triproline motif in mouse and two in human. Moreover, this pathway is considerably downregulated in immune cells from old individuals, making its components suitable biomarkers. Importantly, spermidine improves hypusination of eIF5A, TFEB protein expression, autophagic flux, and antibody titers in old human B cells, which has direct translational relevance."

Here, we first investigated the extent of the decrease across bone marrow progenitors and splenic mature hematopoietic cells, with a method of quantifying endogenous LC3-II, a marker for autophagosomes, using flow cytometry that we adapted for primary hematopoietic cells. To measure active autophagic flux, we used bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), which is a lysosomal V-ATPase inhibitor that prevents acidification of lysosomes and their degradative functions, thereby causing accumulation of autophagic substrates, including LC3-II (Figure 1A). Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were found to have the highest basal autophagy levels compared with other hematopoietic cells. Although their autophagic flux was mildly reduced in old mice, it was significantly decreased in B and T cells from old mice as compared to young mice (Figure 1A; gating strategy in Figures S1A and S1B). Treatment of mice for 6 weeks with spermidine increased autophagic flux in most hematopoietic cell types tested (Figure 1A). We then tested if the in vivo administration of spermidine alleviates typical hallmarks of hematopoietic aging, including expansion of phenotypic HSCs, myeloproliferation, and lymphopenia. We observed a significant increase of phenotypic HSCs and Lin-Sca1+cKit+ cells (LSKs) in old mice, which spermidine administration did not affect (Figures 1B and S1C). A myeloid-biased phenotype, including increased myeloid cells and more significantly diminished mature B and T cells, was found in spleens of old mice (Figures 1C and S1D). Consistently, multiple bone marrow myeloid progenitors are expanded (Figures 1D, S1E, and S1F). Bone marrow pro-B cells (CD43+) also mildly accumulate (Figures 1E, 1F, S1G, and S1H), in line with the paradigm that pro-B cell maturation is blocked with age. Six weeks of treatment with spermidine does not affect these aging phenotypes in either spleen or bone marrow (Figures 1C-1F and S1D-S1H), although longer treatment may confer a more significant effect, as lifespan extension has previously been demonstrated with 6 month treatment."

In contrast, Atg7-deleted B cells showed defective memory responses that mimic the aging phenotype, but spermidine failed to promote their responses (Figures 2E, S2A, and S2B). However, it should be noted that this does not exclude alternative rejuvenation mechanisms of spermidine in addition to autophagy induction. At the time of sacrifice, we found very small numbers of long-lived bone marrow NP-specific plasma cells in old mice, which were significantly restored with spermidine treatment (Figure 2F). Spermidine did not induce autophagy in B cells or T cells or improve the antibody responses in young mice (Figures S2C-S2F).

First, we confirmed 100 muM spermidine to be the optimal concentration to induce autophagy in the mammalian lymphocytic Jurkat cell line (Figures S3A and S3B). Several signaling pathways have been described downstream of spermidine, including inhibition of histone acetyltransferases (HATs). Therefore, we assessed whether spermidine inhibits HAT activity and thereby induces ATG7 mRNA expression, as shown in yeast. In none of three approaches (HAT colorimetric assay, ATG7 qPCR, or acetylated H3 pull-down) did we find that spermidine had this effect (Figures S3C-S3E). The acetyltransferase p300 has been shown to directly acetylate certain autophagy proteins, such as ATG7 to inhibit autophagy, and spermidine was reported to inhibit p300 activity. However, ATG7 acetylation was not affected by two tested concentrations of spermidine within 6 h of treatment (Figures S3E and S3F). Spermidine also failed to affect the activity of AMPK, as assessed using AMPK phosphorylation (Figure S3G). However, we found that spermidine induces cellular stress (Figure S3H) at the autophagy-inducing dose of 100 muM or higher, demonstrated by increased levels of ATF4 (Figure S3I), phosphorylated eIF2alpha (Figure S3J), and increased expression of CHOP mRNA (Figure S3K) in Jurkat cells. Furthermore, high-dose spermidine induced cell death after 24 h (Figure S3L), presumably because spermidine levels are high in transformed cell lines, and further uptake is toxic and non-specifically induces cellular stress responses, likely also inducing autophagy. Cellular stress was also induced by spermidine in NIH 3T3 cells as assessed by increased ATF4 expression (Figure S3M), indicating that high-dose spermidine induces cellular stress across different cell types."

Indeed, genetic KD of Odc with small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Figure S4A), or DFMO treatment, reduces spermidine levels substantially, while supplementing cells with spermidine rescues its levels partially, as measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in cell lysates (Figure 3B). This demonstrates, first, that cultured cells actively synthesize spermidine via ODC and, second, that exogenous spermidine is efficiently taken up to rescue its intracellular levels. Next, we examined pathways downstream of spermidine that had not been previously linked to autophagy. In eukaryotic cells, spermidine is a unique substrate for the hypusination of the translation factor eIF5A (Figure 3A). To date, eIF5A is the only known protein containing the unusual amino acid hypusine. Upon KD of Odc in NIH 3T3 cells, or addition of DFMO, we found reduced LC3-II levels and reduced eIF5A hypusination, while supplementation with spermidine rescued both (Figures 3C, S4B, and S4C). Similarly, reduced LC3-II levels were observed when Eif5a was knocked down (Figures 3D and S4D-S4F). We next depleted the two hypusinating enzymes, deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH), to study their effects on autophagy. The KD of Dhs and knockout (KO) of Dohh, or GC7, a specific inhibitor of DHS, reduced eIF5A hypusination and LC3-II levels (Figures 3E, S4G, and S4H). Although exogenous spermidine restored LC3-II levels in cells depleted of spermidine, inhibition of eIF5A hypusination with siDhs or GC7 abrogated this effect (Figures 3F and S4I). Taken together the data indicate that spermidine maintains cellular basal autophagy by hypusinating eIF5A."

This time-dependent increase correlated with increasing levels of both total and hypusinated eIF5A (Figure 3H). In line with our data in NIH 3T3 cells, LC3-II levels decreased with increasing doses of GC7 (Figure 3I). This pathway operates independently of mTOR, whose activation inhibits autophagy. Indeed, GC7 did not activate mTOR, as demonstrated by S6 phosphorylation, a downstream substrate of mTOR (Figure S4K). Overall the data indicate that the eIF5A-autophagy pathway is induced upon activation of primary B cells, and physiological levels of hypusinated eIF5A are required for efficient autophagy."

        "text": "We next addressed how eIF5A regulates autophagy by identifying changes in expression of proteins involved in the autophagy pathway upon inhibition of eIF5A hypusination. We performed label-free quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) on nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of activated primary B cells treated with GC7 (Figures 4A and S5A). This was followed by stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) on activated primary B cells (Figures 4B and S5B). It has recently been reported that eIF5A regulates ATG3 protein synthesis in cell lines. However, ATG3 protein levels were not found reduced in primary B cells treated with GC7, as shown in our MS results (Figure 4A) and confirmed by western blot (Figure S5C). Of the autophagy-related proteins detected, nuclear TFEB was the only one repeatedly found decreased upon GC7 treatment in both approaches. TFEB is a key transcription factor regulating autophagosomal and lysosomal biogenesis. The effect of inhibition of eIF5A hypusination by GC7 on overall and nuclear TFEB was confirmed by western blot in activated primary B cells (Figures 4C and 4D). Accordingly, gene expression of several TFEB targets was markedly decreased upon GC7 treatment. Genetic KD of Tfeb was sufficient to reduce autophagic flux in NIH 3T3 cells (Figures 4F and S5D), as reported. KD of Eif5a and Dhs, or GC7 treatment in NIH 3T3 cells, led to a decrease in TFEB protein (Figures 4G and 4H). To test if TFEB is affected by spermidine depletion, we inhibited spermidine synthesis in NIH 3T3 cells by siOdc or DFMO. This caused a reduction in TFEB, which was rescued by exogenous spermidine administration (Figures 4I and S5E), suggesting that spermidine controls cellular TFEB levels. However, spermidine failed to maintain TFEB levels when Eif5a was knocked down or eIF5A hypusination was inhibited (Figures 4J, S5F, and S5G), indicating that the regulation of TFEB by spermidine is mediated via eIF5A hypusination."

We first investigated if eIF5A controls overall protein synthesis in lymphocytes, as previously reported. We measured translation by flow cytometry with O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP) and found that inhibition of eIF5A hypusination by GC7 caused a 30% reduction in protein synthesis rate in activated primary B cells (Figure 5A). A similar reduction was observed using a puromycin-independent assay with L-azidohomoalanine (AHA; a methionine analog) incorporation (Figure S5J). To further assess translational changes caused by GC7, we performed ribosome profiling in activated primary B cells. Increased ribosome occupancy at the start codon was observed by GC7 treatment (Figure S5K). However, whether the accumulation of reads at the start codon is an artifact of cycloheximide treatment during sample preparation will require further validation. Stalling of ribosomes at the triproline-encoding motif (PPP) was found in activated primary B cells (Figure S5L), as observed in yeast and bacteria, indicating that polyproline is a conserved ribosome-pausing motif across kingdoms. However, GC7 treatment did not further increase the ribosome occupancy at PPP motifs (Figure S5M). One explanation is that the no-go decay mechanism of mRNA at the severely stalled regions may lead to loss of reads."

        "text": "We next investigated whether TFEB synthesis was affected by GC7 treatment by detecting nascent (recently made) proteins. By pulling down nascent proteins after 4 h of AHA labeling, a significant reduction of nascent TFEB was observed (Figures 5B and S5N). Interestingly, nascent eIF5A was also mildly reduced, suggesting an auto-regulatory loop of eIF5A at the translational level (Figures 5B and S5N). This is not reflected in overall eIF5A levels, probably because of the short treatment and the long half-life of eIF5A. Both human and mouse TFEB have at least one triproline motif (Figure 5C). Indeed, sequences around this triproline are also ribosome-pausing motifs (SPP and PPV), suggesting that this triproline-containing motif may confer TFEB with the specific requirement to rely on eIF5A for smooth translation. Therefore, we examined if the triproline motif in murine and human TFEB is sufficient to affect translation rate as regulated by hypusinated eIF5A. We generated three different constructs, using labile mCherry expression to report on the synthesis of either the TFEB triproline-containing motif, 13 consecutive prolines (13Pro), or a random sequence (Figure 5C). After transfection into NIH 3T3 cells, we measured translation using the ratio of the reporter mCherry to the transfection control GFP. As expected, the mCherry/GFP ratio was mildly reduced by GC7 for the random sequence and reduced by nearly half for the 13Pro motif, while the synthesis of TFEB triproline motif was also significantly inhibited (Figure 5D), indicating that the TFEB triproline motif requires hypusinated eIF5A for efficient synthesis. Moreover, mutating the triproline motif (PPP to AAA) partially rescued the expression of TFEB in the absence of hypusinated eIF5A (Figure 5E), indicating that the triproline motif is one, but not the only mechanism accounting for GC7-induced TFEB reduction. Overexpression of the triproline-mutated TFEB induced autophagy to a similar extent as wild-type TFEB (Figure 5F). However, when the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) was mutated in addition to triprolines, autophagy induction was lost. Taken together this indicates that the polyproline mutation does not compromise the function of TFEB as a transcription factor. Moreover, overexpressing mutant TFEB was sufficient to rescue autophagy in GC7-treated cells (Figure 5G), indicating that TFEB is critical for eIF5A-regulated autophagy. These data suggest that hypusinated eIF5A directly facilitates the synthesis of TFEB partially via the triproline-containing motif. Future studies are required to reveal other mechanisms of eIF5A-regulated TFEB expression."

To investigate the function of hypusinated eIF5A during B cell development and activation in vivo, we generated competitive mixed bone marrow chimeras with inducible deletion of the hypusinating enzyme DHS. Dhs deletion was induced after long-term engraftment and B cell lineage reconstitution of CD45.2+ cells was examined on days 8 and 30 after deletion (Figure S6A). Percentages of CD45.2+ of both transitional and mature circulating B cells in peripheral blood were significantly affected by Dhs deletion on day 30 (Figures S6B and S6C). Upon sacrifice of the mice on day 34, we investigated if this was due to a loss of progenitors in the bone marrow. Unexpectedly, all multipotent hematopoietic progenitors investigated (HSC, MPP, LMPP, and LSK) were severely affected by DHS depletion (Figure S6D). This is in line with a bone marrow hypocellularity reported previously in whole-body Dhs-KO mice. Consistent with depleted HSCs, splenic CD45.2+ myeloid cells, which mostly lack self-renewal capacity and rely on replenishment from progenitor cells, were also severely depleted after Dhs deletion (Figure S6E). Similarly, early B cell progenitors (pre-pro B cells), newly formed B cells and mature B cells from bone marrow as well as splenic transitional, marginal zone and follicular B cells were found significantly diminished (Figures S6F-S6H). The reduced B cell progenitors may result from either loss of HSCs or intrinsic survival defects. We checked if the remaining CD45.2+ cells were indeed deleted for Dhs in blood (Figure S6I), bone marrow, and spleen (Figure S6J). This analysis revealed that although on day 8 after deletion with tamoxifen, blood cells were adequately deleted in the floxed Dhs mice, in cells that survived to day 34, Dhs was not deleted in most mice (Figure S6J). The overall cellularity in bone marrow and spleen was not affected despite the reduced CD45.2+ cell numbers (Figure S6K), indicating that the remaining CD45.1+ and non-deleted CD45.2+ cells expanded and filled up the niche. These data together demonstrate a profound requirement of the eIF5A pathway in hematopoiesis and long-term survival of mature B cells."

As before, after 3 weeks of deletion, all remaining lymphocytes expressed wild-type Dhs only. Levels of NP-specific IgG1 post-boost were not significantly changed in KO mice (data not shown), which can be attributed to contamination from non-deleted memory B cells. Overall the data imply that complete inhibition of eIF5A hypusination kills hematopoietic cells, and its effect on generation of antibodies cannot easily be investigated in vivo, because of (1) the rapid elimination of cells knocked out for Dhs and (2) the limiting deletion efficiency in mature B cells with inducible deletion models."

        "text": "To investigate if this pathway regulates aging in human B cells, we first measured the levels of hypusinated eIF5A and TFEB in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors of different ages. Consistent with our findings in mice, PBMCs from donors aged 65 years and older showed a distinct reduction of TFEB protein. In some aged donors, TFEB was even undetectable by western blot (Figure 7A). In contrast, the mRNA of TFEB was not reduced in PBMCs from old donors (Figure 7B), further indicating that the diminished TFEB protein expression in the elderly is due to post-transcriptional changes. The overall eIF5A was significantly diminished in human PBMCs from donors >=65 years of age, but the remaining eIF5A was well hypusinated (Figure 7A), suggesting that cells may coordinate the expression of overall eIF5A with their hypusination levels during human aging. Indeed, TFEB protein levels correlate well with the expression of eIF5A (Figure S7A). Using mass spectrometry, we show that endogenous spermidine in human PBMCs declines with age (Figure S7B), as reported. Next, we investigated whether TFEB is regulated by spermidine and eIF5A in human primary B cells. Human B cells from young donors stimulated with anti-IgM and CD40L and treated with DFMO ex vivo showed reduced eIF5A hypusination and TFEB, which were rescued by exogenous spermidine supplementation (Figure 7C)."

        "text": "Last and most important, we tested if spermidine improves old human B cell responses. In contrast to non-stimulated naive PBMCs, ex vivo activated old human B cells showed accumulated non-hypusinated eIF5A, suggesting a defect in hypusination (Figure 7D). The levels of both eIF5A hypusination and TFEB (Figures 7D and 7E), as well as autophagic flux (Figure 7F) were significantly restored by spermidine treatment in B cells from aged donors in which spermidine levels are naturally low. IgG production by B cells from aged donors was also improved (Figure 7G). GC7 treatment abrogated these effects of spermidine (Figures 7D-7G), suggesting that spermidine improves autophagy and antibody production of old B cells via hypusinating eIF5A. In contrast, neither the eIF5A-TFEB-autophagy pathway nor IgG production was increased by spermidine in young human B cells (Figures S7C-S7E). Thus, replenishment of spermidine in B cells from aged donors rejuvenated their function via eIF5A hypusination."

        "text": "This study demonstrates that autophagic flux is regulated translationally. Although acute autophagy induction may not require gene expression and protein synthesis, with components being readily available, long-term autophagic flux does depend on continued gene expression. We identified one specific mechanism of this regulation, whereby the polyamine metabolite spermidine is a substrate for the hypusination of the translation factor eIF5A, which in turn controls the synthesis of TFEB protein. This mechanism operates normally in the young, in whom spermidine is abundant. In B cells from old individuals, however, replenishing spermidine levels restored this pathway, thereby boosting responses in vivo in mice and ex vivo in humans. Depleted spermidine levels and subsequent low TFEB expression may be an important cause of the reduction in autophagy in the aging adaptive immune system, as well as in other tissues. However, other potential direct or indirect mechanisms may play a role in the anti-aging effects of polyamines, such as epigenetic modifications or changes in metabolism."

        "text": "It was reported that GC7 induces autophagy in the human fibrosarcoma 2fTGH cell line. The discrepancy between this and our findings may be a result of the high dose of GC7 (200 muM) used as opposed to 10 muM for primary B cells and 100 muM for NIH 3T3 cells used here. Treatment with a high drug dose may induce stress responses and autophagy non-specifically, as demonstrated here for spermidine (Figures S3H-S3M). In line, the study by shows that genetic ablation of eIF5A or of its hypusination enzymes consistently tends to reduce (not induce) LC3-II expression in 2fTGH cells."

        "text": "Translation in lymphocytes is little studied in T cells and B cells. Naive B cells are in a metabolically quiescent state, with low protein synthesis (low eIF5A expression) and autophagy, both of which are quickly upregulated after activation. Autophagy and the translation machinery may then form a regulatory loop to support the metabolic requirements of proliferation and immunoglobulin production. In this loop, autophagy provides substrates and energy for increased translation, while inducing the synthesis of certain autophagic proteins such as TFEB. Specifically, a particular requirement for rapid provision of amino acids and unfolded protein degradation by autophagy may exist in long-lived plasma cells, which secrete antibodies at the rate of about 2,000 molecules per second."

        "text": "The anti-aging function of TFEB seems to be highly conserved across species. Earlier studies found it to be an important transcription factor for lifespan extension in C. elegans. Moreover, it is likely that the control of TFEB via translation is a broad, maybe universal mechanism, operating across many tissue types (here in NIH 3T3 cells and in mouse and human primary B cells). TFEB is known to be post-translationally controlled via (1) mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation for cytoplasmic retention, and (2) calcium-dependent dephosphorylation to signal for nuclear translocation. We now add an mTOR-independent step of regulation at the level of translation."

        "text": "ATG3 protein synthesis was recently reported to be controlled by hypusinated eIF5A in cell lines. However, we could not find a reduction of ATG3 with GC7 treatment in primary B cells, indicating that it may be cell type specific (Figures 4A and S5C). MHC II also contains polyproline motifs but did not reduce with GC7 treatment either (Figure S6L). These observations suggest that the presence of a polyproline motif alone is insufficient to cause reduced protein expression by inhibition of hypusinated eIF5A. Indeed, research in bacteria showed that polyproline-induced stalls may lead to reduced protein levels only if they limit translation more than initiation. Moreover, an auto-regulatory loop exists for the regulation of Tfeb transcription. Therefore, defective TFEB synthesis may initiate a vicious cycle involving reduced Tfeb transcription (Figure 4E) and further reduced protein synthesis, eventually leading to overall diminished TFEB protein. Additionally, we hypothesize that a stronger stalling motif (such as SPPPVP in TFEB), and TFEB's short half-life may contribute to reduced protein expression in the absence of hypusinated eIF5A, and predict that other such proteins are regulated by eIF5A."

        "text": "We have shown eIF5A and TFEB levels are correlated with age in immune cells. Blood aging biomarkers are urgently needed to gauge the efficacy of new drugs that prolong health span. Autophagy is one of the few general mechanisms underpinning many age-related diseases and is therefore a good target for anti-aging drugs. Last, it has been accepted for decades that hypusination occurs during or shortly after the synthesis of eIF5A, and the majority of cellular eIF5A is in its hypusinated form unless artificial treatments are being used to block the hypusination pathway. Here we show that under certain physiological conditions, such as aging, a significant pool of non-hypusinated eIF5A accumulates, probably because of the lack of spermidine (Figures 6E, 7D, and 7E). This indicates that hypusination of eIF5A can potentially be harnessed therapeutically for aging or age-related diseases."

Serum samples diluted in 1% milk were added and incubated at 37 C for 1 hour. For relative quantification, a standard serum sample was made by pooling samples on day 7 post secondary immunization from a prior experiment, which was used for all subsequent experiments. Serum samples of various days were serially diluted first to determine the proper dilution, and 1:1000-1:5000 was chosen for NP-IgG1 ELISA. After serum sample incubation, plates were washed 6 times with PBS-0.05% Tween 20 followed with detection antibody incubation at 37 C for 1 hour. Alkaline phosphatase- (AP-) conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG1 (Southern Biotech) detection antibody was diluted in 1% milk-PBS at a ratio of 1:2000.
