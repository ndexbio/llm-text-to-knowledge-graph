ANK3 variants (encoding ankyrin-G) are associated with bipolar disorder, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder, while mutations in USP9X, which encodes a deubiquitinase, are associated with X-linked intellectual disability and autism in humans. Here, we show that TGF-beta signaling promotes Usp9X phosphorylation, which enhances its interaction with ankyrin-G and stabilizes ankyrin-G in spines, leading to spine enlargement. Using in situ proximity ligation combined with structured illumination superresolution microscopy, we characterize the postsynaptic spatial organization of phosphorylation-dependent regulation of Usp9X/ankyrin-G interactions in dendrites and its quantitative relationship with spine morphology and number. These data reveal a cytokine-mediated mechanism regulating protein stability in spines and suggest a role for deubiquitination and TGF-beta signaling in neurodevelopmental disorder pathogenesis and treatment.",

Among these, rare and common variants at the ANK3 gene locus were identified in patients with ASD and ID/attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and are among the most strongly associated risk factors for BD in genome-wide association studies (GWASs). ANK3 encodes ankyrin-G, which acts as a scaffold linking plasma membrane proteins to the actin/beta-spectrin cytoskeleton. Multiple isoforms of ankyrin-G (190/270/480 kDa) are expressed in the brain and share four conserved domains: an ankyrin repeat domain (ANKRD), a spectrin-binding domain, a death domain, and a regulatory domain. The giant 270/480-kDa isoforms have well-characterized roles at the axon initial segment (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier, and the 190-kDa form is enriched in dendrites and postsynaptic densities (PSDs) and regulates spine structure. Despite their importance, little is known about how the levels of ANKRD proteins, in particular at synapses, are regulated.",

            "text": "One of the major mechanisms controlling postsynaptic proteins is their regulated degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which also plays an important role in synaptic remodeling. Synapse remodeling is accompanied by changes in protein turnover, which occurs via regulated increases or decreases in protein degradation. Proteins are generally targeted for degradation by the UPS through the covalent addition of polyubiquitin chains to their lysine residues. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) oppose this process by removing ubiquitin from substrate proteins. Activation or inhibition of DUBs induces synaptic plasticity. Recent studies support a role for dysregulation of the UPS pathway in SZ, BD, ID, and ASDs, suggesting that protein turnover may play an important role in neurodevelopmental disorders. However, little is known about the synaptic targets of DUBs and about how deubiquitination of PSD proteins impacts spine plasticity and contributes to disease pathogenesis.",

In the current study, we show that the neuroprotective factor TGF-beta initializes a signaling cascade causing Usp9X phosphorylation and subsequent stabilization of ankyrin-G in spines. Using structured illumination microscopy (SIM), we found that ankyrin-G and Usp9X localize to distinct nanostructures within spines, the number of which correlates to mushroom spine head size, while proximity ligation assay (PLA)/SIM confirmed that TGF-beta increases ankyrin-G's interaction with Usp9X.

However, because TGF-beta receptors, which are Ser/Thr kinases, can also act by phosphorylating other substrates, we hypothesized that TGF-beta signaling may also directly regulate Usp9X function and its interaction with substrates for deubiquitination. We thus investigated the role of TGF-beta in regulating the Usp9X/ankyrin-G interaction. Ankyrin-G was costained for either TGF-beta receptor I or TGF-beta receptor II to understand the expression patterns of TGF-beta receptor in ankyrin-Gpositive neurons. TGF-beta receptors I and II were localized to both the AIS and dendrites, and they overlapped strongly with ankyrin-G in dendrites (Figure 1A); both receptor proteins were present at significantly higher levels in the dendrites than the AIS (Figure 1B). Next, to determine whether TGF-beta affected the expression of ankyrin-G and Usp9X, neurons were treated with TGF-beta for 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 3 h, and 6 h. As expected, TGF-beta treatment resulted in a robust increase in Smad2 phosphorylation after 1 h, a known signaling component downstream of TGF-beta (Figure 1C). Interestingly, ankyrin-G protein levels increased after TGF-beta treatment, while Usp9X levels were not affected. Our previous studies have suggested that ankyrin-G plays an important role in spine development. Therefore, we tested the impact of TGF-beta on dendritic spine morphology in cultured cortical neurons. TGF-beta treatment caused a significant increase in spine head size and density (Figures 1E and 1F). Taken together, the TGF-beta-mediated increase in ankyrin-G may regulate spine development.",

As Usp9X levels remained consistent following TGF-beta stimulation, we hypothesized that post-translational modifications (PTMs) of Usp9X may be altered. We identified three S/T phosphorylation consensus sites (Serine 1,593/1,600/1,609) within the Usp9X peptidase domain (residues 1,555-1,958), and previous mass spectrometry studies have revealed that these sites are subject to PTM. All three serine sites are predicted to lie distal to the catalytic triad and are likely exposed for PTM (Figure 3A). To confirm the interaction between the ANKRD of ankyrin-G and the peptidase domain of Usp9X, we conducted a pulldown assay. Nickel-bead-bound His-Usp9X1,547-1,962 showed pull-down of AnkG1-807 (Figure 3B). In order to assess whether these sites are subject to PTM following TGF-beta stimulation, we carried out mutagenesis on the isolated peptidase domain of Usp9X (Usp9XWt) to create a phosphorylation-null triple mutant (Usp9XS3A). TGF-beta treatment produced a robust increase in serine phosphorylation in Usp9XWt, but not in Usp9XS3A, suggesting that Usp9X is a downstream target of TGF-beta receptor activation (Figure 3C). Interestingly, treatment with TGF-beta enhanced the reciprocal interaction between AnkG1-807 and Usp9XWt, but this effect was not observed with Usp9XS3A (Figure 3C). To validate the interaction of Usp9X and ankyrin-G within a cellular context, we employed in situ PLA. This technique labels interacting proteins that fall within a defined, 16-nm distance as calculated from the number of nucleotides in the attached DNA arms, a strong indicator of direct protein-protein interaction or complex formation. The PLA signal increased significantly after TGF-beta treatment; however, this effect was absent when Usp9XS3A was employed (Figures 3D and 3E). As both 190-kDa and 480-kDa ankyrin-G isoforms share an ANKRD, we tested the interaction of Usp9X with the giant ankyrin-G (ankyrin-G 480). Consistent with the 190-kDa isoform, TGF-beta-mediated Usp9X phosphorylation showed the enhancement in ankyrin-G 480 binding to Usp9X (Figure S1). Taken together, TGF-beta-mediated phosphorylation of the peptidase domain of Usp9X enhances the interaction between ankyrin-G and Usp9X, an effect that may underlie the morphological effects on dendritic spine area, density, and axonal outgrowth.",

We then utilized SIM to investigate the spatial relationship between the sites of ankyrin-G-Usp9X interaction within spine heads and spine head size (Figure 4C). Likewise, the number of PLA puncta in dendritic shaft and spines increased in ankyrin-G with Usp9XWt with TGF-beta treatment (Figure S3). Spine heads containing ankyrin-G were significantly larger than spine heads without ankyrin-G (Figure 4D), as previously reported. Interestingly, TGF-beta treatment increased the ratio of ankyrin-G-containing spines coincident with an increase in PLA-positive spines (Figure 4E), and it promoted an increase in spine head size (Figure 4F). PLA signals were partially overlapping with and around ankyrin-G and Usp9X clusters and localized to the perisynaptic areas of spines (Figures 5A and 5B). To analyze the effects of TGF-beta treatment on the correlation among the size of ankyrin-G, Usp9X, PLA nanodomains, and spine heads, equivalence tests were performed with confidence intervals. Unexpectedly, TGF-beta treatment did not show any superior effects on correlations (Figures 5C-5F). Spine heads, which include ankyrin-G, Usp9X, and PLA nanodomains concurrently, showed the same phenotype whether TGF-beta treated or not, suggesting that TGF-beta treatment increases the number of ankyrin-G-containing spines and spine head size through upregulation of the interaction between Usp9X and ankyrin-G.",

We transfected neurons with either control or shUsp9X and co-transfected with GFP-tagged Usp9XWt or Usp9XS3A. Overexpression of Usp9XS3A significantly decreased spine head size and spine density in control shRNA-transfected neurons (Figure 6A). In addition, overexpression of Usp9XWt rescued the effect of shUsp9X on spine head size and spine density; however, overexpression of Usp9XS3A could not rescue the spine phenotype. The effect of TGF-beta was prevented by overexpression of Usp9XS3A (Figures 6B and 6C). These data suggest that phosphorylation of the peptidase domain of Usp9X is important for regulating spine head size and generating new spines in response to TGF-beta.",
