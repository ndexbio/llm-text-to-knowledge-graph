Synapse remodeling is accompanied by changes in protein turnover, which occurs via regulated increases or decreases in protein degradation. Proteins are generally targeted for degradation by the UPS through the covalent addition of polyubiquitin chains to their lysine residues. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) oppose this process by removing ubiquitin from substrate proteins. Activation or inhibition of DUBs induces synaptic plasticity. Recent studies support a role for dysregulation of the UPS pathway in SZ, BD, ID, and ASDs, suggesting that protein turnover may play an important role in neurodevelopmental disorders. However, little is known about the synaptic targets of DUBs and about how deubiquitination of PSD proteins impacts spine plasticity and contributes to disease pathogenesis.",

We transfected neurons with either control or shUsp9X and co-transfected with GFP-tagged Usp9XWt or Usp9XS3A.

We transfected neurons with either control or shUsp9X and co-transfected with GFP-tagged Usp9XWt or Usp9XS3A. Overexpression of Usp9XS3A significantly decreased spine head size and spine density in control shRNA-transfected neurons (Figure 6A). In addition, overexpression of Usp9XWt rescued the effect of shUsp9X on spine head size and spine density; however, overexpression of Usp9XS3A could not rescue the spine phenotype. The effect of TGF-beta was prevented by overexpression of Usp9XS3A (Figures 6B and 6C). These data suggest that phosphorylation of the peptidase domain of Usp9X is important for regulating spine head size and generating new spines in response to TGF-beta.",

For example, TGF-beta protects synapses against Abeta oligomers in an Alzheimer's disease model; it protects neurons in Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ischemia and promotes nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuron survival. By enhancing the efficiency of Usp9X-mediated deubiquitination toward its substrates, leading to stabilization of ankyrin-G and perhaps other ANKRD proteins, TGF-beta could be developed into a therapeutic strategy to recover synaptic deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders.",

Here, we show that TGF-beta signaling promotes Usp9X phosphorylation, which enhances its interaction with ankyrin-G and stabilizes ankyrin-G in spines, leading to spine enlargement. Using in situ proximity ligation combined with structured illumination superresolution microscopy, we characterize the postsynaptic spatial organization of phosphorylation-dependent regulation of Usp9X/ankyrin-G interactions in dendrites and its quantitative relationship with spine morphology and number. These data reveal a cytokine-mediated mechanism regulating protein stability in spines and suggest a role for deubiquitination and TGF-beta signaling in neurodevelopmental disorder pathogenesis and treatment."

In the current study, we show that the neuroprotective factor TGF-beta initializes a signaling cascade causing Usp9X phosphorylation and subsequent stabilization of ankyrin-G in spines. Using structured illumination microscopy (SIM), we found that ankyrin-G and Usp9X localize to distinct nanostructures within spines, the number of which correlates to mushroom spine head size, while proximity ligation assay (PLA)/SIM confirmed that TGF-beta increases ankyrin-G's interaction with Usp9X. These data reveal that TGF-beta can enhance stabilization of ankyrin-G in spines through the increase of Usp9X binding ability toward its target substrate."

By enhancing the efficiency of Usp9X-mediated deubiquitination toward its substrates, leading to stabilization of ankyrin-G and perhaps other ANKRD proteins, TGF-beta could be developed into a therapeutic strategy to recover synaptic deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders."
