                "description": "SIRT1/PARP1 crosstalk: connecting DNA damage and metabolism\n\nAn intricate network regulates the activities of SIRT1 and PARP1 proteins and continues to be uncovered. Both SIRT1 and PARP1 share a common co-factor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and several common substrates, including regulators of DNA damage response and circadian rhythms. We review this complex network using an interactive Molecular Interaction Map (MIM) to explore the interplay between these two proteins. Here we discuss how NAD\u2009+\u2009competition and post-transcriptional/translational feedback mechanisms create a regulatory network sensitive to environmental cues, such as genotoxic stress and metabolic states, and examine the role of those interactions in DNA repair and ultimately, cell fate decisions.",

Here a potential contradiction in the role of SIRT1 in condensing chromatin arises whereby SIRT1 deacetylation activity could potentially help drive the PARP1 ADP-ribosylation activity on H4K16. Currently, it is known that SIRT1 plays a role in DNA damage repair via histone deacetylation through the deacetylation of the two histone acetyltransferases, TIP60 and MOF, which are able to acetylate histone H4 [[A23]]. Deacetylation of these two proteins promotes their ubiquitin-dependent degradation affecting DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair either through the repression of repair or affecting the choice of repair mechanism (i.e. homologous recombination or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)) . TIP60-dependent acetylation of H4K16 inhibits the binding of 53BP1 to H4K20me2, which promotes non-homologous end joining [[A24]] . Further studies are needed to understand how DNA damage might affect modifications on the various histones though it is known that genotoxic stress causes a random redistribution of SIRT1 across the genome with a correlated increase in levels of H1K26 acetylation . However, while PARP1 does localize to DNA strand breaks, it is also not known whether there is any further global redistribution PARP1 or a relationship to the redistribution of SIRT1.",

Here we present three cases of these interactions; these interactions range include both direct modifications, as well as transcriptional regulation.
