The observation that miR-145 is necessary and sufficient for VSMC differentiation raises the possibility that restoration of this miRNA could suppress the smooth muscle hyperplasia observed in vascular injury and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, the multiple targets we identified for miR-143 and miR-145 reveal an elegant mechanism by which this family of miRNAs promotes differentiation and simultaneously represses proliferation of VSMCs by converging on SRF-dependent co-activators and co-repressors. Our findings suggest miR-145 may promote VSMC differentiation in part by increasing Myocd protein and functioning in a feed-forward reinforcement of its own expression by the SRF-Myocd complex, while miR-143 represses Myocd's competitor, Elk-1. Given the potent effects on differentiation shown here, future studies will determine if restoration of normal levels of miR-143 and miR-145 holds therapeutic value in the setting of disease.",

This is consistent with its early expression in the aorta of developing embryos as VSMC differentiation is initiated from neural crest and mesodermal progenitors. Once VSMC identity is established in the embryo, the downregulation of miR-143 and miR-145 in the developing embryo may allow necessary proliferation. Subsequent upregulation postnatally (coincident with the more differentiated VSMC state) and downregulation during neointimal hyperplasia indicate dynamic regulation that may contribute to the oscillating state of VSMCs.

The targeting of Klf4 supports this notion, as Klf4 is expressed in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and in other less differentiated cell types. Recent evidence indicates that miR-145 represses Klf4 in human embryonic stem cells as they begin to differentiate and is required for normal differentiation. Since Klf4 is one of four factors described by Yamanaka and colleagues that together are sufficient to reprogram human fibroblasts into a pluripotent state (induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells), it will be interesting to determine whether inhibition of miR-145 can enhance generation of iPS cells.",
