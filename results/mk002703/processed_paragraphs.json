A diagram convention was designed capable of unambiguous representation of networks containing multiprotein complexes, protein modifications, and enzymes that are substrates of other enzymes. To facilitate linkage to a database, each molecular species is symbolically represented only once in each diagram. Molecular species can be located on the map by means of indexed grid coordinates. Each interaction is referenced to an annotation list where pertinent information and references can be found. Parts of the network are grouped into functional subsystems. The map shows how multiprotein complexes could assemble and function at gene promoter sites and at sites of DNA damage. It also portrays the richness of connections between the p53-Mdm2 subsystem and other parts of the network."

Current diagrams of molecular interactions are often ambiguous or incomplete. The preparation of more comprehensive regulatory network diagrams is both difficult and urgent. The difficulties are not due merely to the large number of reactions, because this is a feature also of the familiar metabolic pathway diagrams. They are due rather to complexities that rarely occur in classical pathway diagrams, such as multisubunit complexes, protein modifications, enzymes that are modified by other enzymes, and protein domains whose function is regulated by other domains of the same molecule. The present work describes and applies a diagram method designed to cope with these kinds of complexity."

Multimer proteins are common components of regulatory systems and sometimes function in large-scale multimolecular assemblies.

E2F in fact more often functions to repress rather than activate. E2F proteins (as heterodimers with a DP protein) have individual binding preferences for pRb family members. The E2F-pRb box shows that pRb prefers E2F-1-, -2-, or -3-containing heterodimers (with lesser interaction with E2F-4), p107 binds only E2F-4 heterodimers, and p130 can bind heterodimers of E2F-4 or 5.

Because these sites are located within the region required for Mdm2 binding, it is plausible that their phosphorylation could inhibit this interaction. p53 forms a stable complex with p300, as a result of which p300 acetylates p53 Lys382. This acetylation, as well as the acetylation of Lys320 by PCAF, enhances the sequence-specific binding of p53 to promoters, probably indirectly by inhibiting nonspecific DNA binding.

A given protein may have more than one binding site for a second protein: p300, for example, has two separated sites for binding of p53. Multimolecular complexes thus may have alternative, functionally different configurations, and covalent modifications could induce configurational switches. The details of these interdependencies may be critically important, but only fragmentary information is as yet available."

        "text": "Promoter regulation can be very complicated, because transcription factors can have positive or negative effects, depending on their environments and mutual interactions. Genes controlled in part by the same transcription factors sometimes exhibit different regulation patterns. Moreover, the interactions among the different transcription factors are only beginning to be elucidated. It was therefore not feasible, in the present diagrams, to show the full regulation pattern of each individual gene. The regulation of the E2F-dependent S-phase genes and of the p53-dependent genes highlight the difficulties. The major known regulatory actions on these genes are shown, and some of the details regarding effects on individual genes are mentioned in the annotation list."

        "text": "A diagram convention such as that described here will be needed for the representation of functional models. These \u201cheuristic\u201d diagrams do not fully define the contingencies among the interactions. For simulation of models, however, \u201cexplicit\u201d or fully defined diagrams are needed. Suitable explicit diagrams can be prepared using a subset of the present symbols or using the conventions of electronic circuitry."

        "text": "This exercise has suggested how a large body of molecular interaction data can be organized in a map with associated annotations. Many of the known interactions relating to cell cycle control and DNA repair events in the nucleus were included in the map. Some important areas remain to be added: in particular, the control of nuclear\u2013cytoplasmic shuttling of key regulatory molecules and the signaling pathways from growth factor receptors on the cell surface. The molecular interaction map will require frequent updating as new information accrues. For this purpose, we plan to put updated versions the map on the Internet."
