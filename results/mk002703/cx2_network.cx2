Ser15 appears to be the site of phosphorylation responses to DNA damage signals communicated by way of the kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene/protein (ATM) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Phosphorylation of Ser18 or Ser20 prevents stable binding to Mdm2, thus abrogating the Mdm2-mediated inhibition and degradation of p53. Because these sites are located within the region required for Mdm2 binding, it is plausible that their phosphorylation could inhibit this interaction. p53 forms a stable complex with p300, as a result of which p300 acetylates p53 Lys382. This acetylation, as well as the acetylation of Lys320 by PCAF, enhances the sequence-specific binding of p53 to promoters, probably indirectly by inhibiting nonspecific DNA binding. A similar mechanism of enhanced promoter binding may occur as a result of binding of the p53 C-terminal region to 14-3-3, which requires 14-3-3 to be dimerized.",

DNA double-strand ends are recognized and bound by the Ku70:Ku80 heterodimer (Ku), which can recruit DNA-PK to the site, thereby activating the kinase. DNA-PK, however, can also bind to RPA. RPA is a heterotrimer that binds ssDNA regions. DNA-PK can thus be recruited to ssDNA regions formed transiently at replication forks. DNA-PK may then be available for interaction with a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) end, which could appear in the vicinity as a consequence of replication fork encounters with open topoisomerase I DNA complexes trapped by drugs such as camptothecin. It is noteworthy that DNA-PK does not always require Ku for activation, because it can be activated by tethering to DNA via other molecules, such as chromatin constituents of the HMG family.",
