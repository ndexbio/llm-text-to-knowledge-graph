A diagram convention was designed capable of unambiguous representation of networks containing multiprotein complexes, protein modifications, and enzymes that are substrates of other enzymes. To facilitate linkage to a database, each molecular species is symbolically represented only once in each diagram. Molecular species can be located on the map by means of indexed grid coordinates. Each interaction is referenced to an annotation list where pertinent information and references can be found. Parts of the network are grouped into functional subsystems. The map shows how multiprotein complexes could assemble and function at gene promoter sites and at sites of DNA damage. It also portrays the richness of connections between the p53-Mdm2 subsystem and other parts of the network.",

Current diagrams of molecular interactions are often ambiguous or incomplete. The preparation of more comprehensive regulatory network diagrams is both difficult and urgent. The difficulties are not due merely to the large number of reactions, because this is a feature also of the familiar metabolic pathway diagrams. They are due rather to complexities that rarely occur in classical pathway diagrams, such as multisubunit complexes, protein modifications, enzymes that are modified by other enzymes, and protein domains whose function is regulated by other domains of the same molecule. The present work describes and applies a diagram method designed to cope with these kinds of complexity.",

First, it is often difficult to keep in mind all of the known interactions that may be pertinent to a particular experimental or theoretical question, and a molecular interaction map can be used in much the same way as a road map or electronic circuit diagram. Second, molecular interaction maps can suggest new interpretations or questions for experiment. Third, the act of preparing a molecular interaction map imposes a discipline of logic and critique to the formulation of functional models. Finally, the diagram convention provides a shorthand for recording complicated findings or hypotheses.",

Multimer proteins are common components of regulatory systems and sometimes function in large-scale multimolecular assemblies. Therefore, an extensible representation of such complexes was a fundamental requirement. A third major consideration was the representation of protein modifications, such as phosphorylations.

Thus noncovalent binding in most cases is represented symmetrically. In some cases, however, it is useful to distinguish a protein that has a receptor site from a protein that donates a peptide binding to the site, for example the binding of an N-terminal peptide of p53 to a pocket in Mdm2. The receptor end of an interaction line can be represented by a double-barbed arrowhead. This notation can serve to indicate targets of opportunity for pharmacological intervention. Noncovalent binding is generally assumed to be reversible; when binding is unusually tight, the interaction line can be drawn heavier.",

The simplest arrangement would be an E2F:DP heterodimer bound to an E2 element. Because promoters generally have two or more E2F recognition elements, however, the actual situation even in this case may be far from simple. Most E2F family proteins can activate transcription by way of a transactivation domain. E2F-6, however, has instead a transcription repressor domain. E2F:DP heterodimers (other than those of E2F-6) can tether pRb family proteins onto promoters, thereby converting a potential gene activator into a repressor. E2F in fact more often functions to repress rather than activate. E2F proteins (as heterodimers with a DP protein) have individual binding preferences for pRb family members. The E2F-pRb box shows that pRb prefers E2F-1-, -2-, or -3-containing heterodimers (with lesser interaction with E2F-4), p107 binds only E2F-4 heterodimers, and p130 can bind heterodimers of E2F-4 or 5. All of these complexes can bind and repress E2F recognition elements. E2F-6, however, does not bind any pRb family protein. E2F-1, -2, and -3 are marked together as a unit on the map, because of their mutual preference for pRb. Although there are significant functional distinctions between them, the molecular bases for these differences is not known. No major functional differences among different DP family members have been defined.",

All Cdks are activated by phosphorylation of Thr160 (or 161), carried out by CycH:Cdk7, which functions also as a constituent of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex. Cdk1, and to some extent other Cdks, can be inhibited by phosphorylations corresponding to Thr14 and/or Tyr15. These sites are phosphorylated by Wee1 or Myt1. In the case of Cdk1, these inhibitory phosphorylations are removed by dual-action phosphatase Cdc25C, which is in turn activated by phosphorylations introduced by mammalian polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and/or Cdk1. Cdc25C can be phosphorylated at Ser216 by Chk1 or C-TAK1. Ser216 phosphorylation generates a binding site for 14-3-3, and this binding inhibits the phosphatase.",

Eleven phosphorylation or acetylation sites (or groups of sites) for which functionality has been surmised are shown. If all of these could occur independently, there would be approximately 2000 possible modification states of p53 monomers. Some interdependent modifications have been noted: phosphorylation of Thr18 requires previous phosphorylation of Ser15; acetylation of Lys320 requires tetramer structure of p53 and is inhibited by phosphorylation of Ser378. Other dependencies certainly exist, some perhaps having major functional impact, whereas many could have subtle quantitative effects, which may or may not convey a selective evolutionary advantage.

Ser15 appears to be the site of phosphorylation responses to DNA damage signals communicated by way of the kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene/protein (ATM) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Phosphorylation of Ser18 or Ser20 prevents stable binding to Mdm2, thus abrogating the Mdm2-mediated inhibition and degradation of p53. Because these sites are located within the region required for Mdm2 binding, it is plausible that their phosphorylation could inhibit this interaction. p53 forms a stable complex with p300, as a result of which p300 acetylates p53 Lys382. This acetylation, as well as the acetylation of Lys320 by PCAF, enhances the sequence-specific binding of p53 to promoters, probably indirectly by inhibiting nonspecific DNA binding. A similar mechanism of enhanced promoter binding may occur as a result of binding of the p53 C-terminal region to 14-3-3, which requires 14-3-3 to be dimerized.",

The map shows the dependencies relating to tetramers; tetramerization is stimulated by phosphorylation of Ser392, and this enhancement can be inhibited by phosphorylation of Ser315. The ability to form tetramers is further modulated by other modifications and protein interactions. Influence on tetramerization may be how p53 transcriptional activity is stimulated by binding BRCA1 and inhibited by binding Mdm2, PARP, or RPA. This could be the major mechanism of regulation of p53 transcriptional activity. The activation of p53 seems to be exquisitely controlled by a large number of determinative inputs. The transition to active tetramers could be very sharp because of a possible fourth-power dependence on the concentration of tetramerization-competent monomers.",

RPA is a heterotrimer that binds ssDNA regions. DNA-PK can thus be recruited to ssDNA regions formed transiently at replication forks. DNA-PK may then be available for interaction with a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) end, which could appear in the vicinity as a consequence of replication fork encounters with open topoisomerase I DNA complexes trapped by drugs such as camptothecin.

To provide a foundation for eventual understanding of function, this information must be organized in a manner that allows integrated behavior to be discerned. Molecular interaction maps such as those described here could contribute to this goal. The primary objective here was to suggest how complex molecular interaction networks can be usefully displayed. The map was constructed from evidence relating to molecular interactions with the view that the interaction patterns would suggest biological functions. The complexity of the map, however, demands that great care be taken in the formulation of specific functional hypotheses, which may have to be investigated with the aid of computer simulations.",

A recent example and possible paradigm is the large multiprotein binder and acetyl transferase p300, which may function as a platform for the assembly of high-order complexes. Multiprotein interactions may be competitive, cooperative, or independent of each other, possibly depending on the modification states of the component molecules. Moreover, susceptibility to modification may depend on the multimolecular configuration. A given protein may have more than one binding site for a second protein: p300, for example, has two separated sites for binding of p53. Multimolecular complexes thus may have alternative, functionally different configurations, and covalent modifications could induce configurational switches. The details of these interdependencies may be critically important, but only fragmentary information is as yet available.",
