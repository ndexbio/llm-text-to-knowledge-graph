AKT2 promoted a significant increase in HSF1 activity, but the effect was modest while AKT3 had no significant effect on HSF1 activity (Fig. 1A-C). To determine the ability of the AKT isoforms to phosphorylate HSF1 at S326, a key phosphorylation event critical for HSF1 activity, an in vitro kinase assay followed by immunoblotting was performed with each AKT isoform. Both AKT1 and AKT2 phosphorylated S326 of HSF1 at similar levels but AKT3 showed no capability for phosphorylating S326 (Fig. 1D)."}},{"id":8,"s":2,"t":10,"v":{"evidence":"Mass spectrometry showed that AKT1 also phosphorylated HSF1 at T142, S230 and T527 in addition to S326, whereas the other kinases did not.","interaction":"directlyIncreases","bel_expression":"act(p(HGNC:AKT1), ma(GO:\"kinase activity\")) directlyIncreases p(HGNC:HSF1, pmod(Ph, Thr, 527))","text":"The heat stress response activates the transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), which subsequently upregulates heat shock proteins to maintain the integrity of the proteome.

The global diabetic crisis has not abated despite the introduction of new types of drugs and targets. Persistent unaddressed patient needs remain a significant factor in the quest for new leads in routine studies. Drug discovery methods in this area have followed developments in the market, contributing to a recent rise in the number of molecules. Nevertheless, troubling developments and fresh challenges are still evident. Recently, metformin, the most widely used first-line drug for diabetes, was found to contain a carcinogenic contaminant known as N-nitroso dimethylamine (NDMA). Therefore, purity and toxicity are also a big challenge for drug discovery and development. Moreover, newer drug classes against SGLT-2 illustrate both progress and difficulties. The same was true previously in the case of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Furthermore, researchers must study the importance of mechanistic characteristics of novel compounds, as well as exposure-related hazardous aspects of current and newly identified protein targets, in order to identify new pharmacological molecules with improved selectivity and specificity."}}]},
