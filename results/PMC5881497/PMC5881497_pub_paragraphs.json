In this study, we report that SLAMF1 is required for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated induction of interferon beta (IFNbeta) and for killing of Gram-negative bacteria by human macrophages. We found that SLAMF1 controls trafficking of the Toll receptor-associated molecule (TRAM) from the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) to Escherichia coli phagosomes. In resting macrophages, SLAMF1 is localized to ERC, but upon addition of E. coli, it is trafficked together with TRAM from ERC to E. coli phagosomes in a Rab11-dependent manner. We found that endogenous SLAMF1 protein interacted with TRAM and defined key interaction domains as amino acids 68 to 95 of TRAM as well as 15 C-terminal amino acids of SLAMF1. Interestingly, the SLAMF1-TRAM interaction was observed for human but not mouse proteins. Overall, our observations suggest that SLAMF1 is a new target for modulation of TLR4-TRAM-TRIF inflammatory signaling in human cells."

TLR4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria in complex with the coreceptors myeloid differentiation factor 2 and CD14, and it recruits signaling adapters myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and MyD88 adapter-like (Mal). This results in an immediate activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and production of proinflammatory cytokines. TLR4 is also present on endosomes and phagosomes to which the signaling adapter Toll receptor-associated molecule (TRAM) is recruited.

All FIP2 deletion mutants in IPs lacked a C-terminal Rab11 binding domain (Fig. 7, B, E, and F) and showed better coprecipitation with SLAMF1 without Rab11 overexpression, which suggested that Rab11 has a critical role in controlling FIP2-SLAMF1 interactions."

FIP2Flag was precipitated from cells, which coexpressed SLAMF1 with either Rab11a WT, GTP-bound Rab11Q70L, or GDP-bound Rab11a S25N (Fig. 7 G). FIP2Flag coprecipitated with SLAMF1 only in the presence of Rab11 WT and Rab11Q70L but not Rab11 serine mutant (Fig. 7 G). We also found that the interaction domain for FIP2 in SLAMF1ct was distinctly different from the TRAM interaction domain (Figs. 6 F and 7, I and J). Our results suggest that TLR4-induced activation of Rab11 is a signal for the recruitment of SLAMF1 and TRAM via the FIPs to E. coli phagosomes and that class I FIPs may link the SLAMF1-TRAM complex to Rab11."

This raised an important question of whether SLAMF1 could regulate the subsequent formation of TLR4-TRAM-TRIF complex needed for LPS-mediated signaling. To address this question, HEK cells were cotransfected by SLAMF1Flag, TRAMYFP, and TLR4Cherry or TRIFHA, and their interactions were monitored by co-IP with SLAMF1Flag. Both TLR4Cherry and TRIFHA coprecipitated with SLAMF1Flag in the presence of TRAMYFP (Fig. 8, A and B). In addition, SLAMF1 did not coprecipitate with TLR4Flag in the absence of TRAMYFP (Fig. 8 C). Overexpression of SLAMF1 did not alter the ability of TLR4 to attract TRIF via TRAM despite that SLAMF1 also coprecipitated with the complex in the presence of TRAM and TRIF (Fig. 8 D). Furthermore, TRIF overexpression strongly enhanced SLAMF1 coprecipitation with TLR4Flag (Fig. 8 E). In summary, SLAMF1 binding to TRAM seems to be unique and outside of the TIR-TIR dimerization domain as it does not interfere with TRAM-TLR4 interaction and subsequent TRIF recruitment."

TRAM is a crucial adapter for TRIF recruitment to activated TLR4, leading to the activation of TBK1 and IKKepsilon. Upon TLR4 ligation, TBK1 and IKKepsilon phosphorylate Akt kinase (S473), resulting in Akt activation. In turn, the Akt-mTORC1 signaling axis can drive phagocytosis, phagosome maturation, and ROS production, which are essential for bacterial killing. As expected, TRAM KO cells had no detectable IRF3 phosphorylation in response to E. coli particles (Fig. 9 D). In control cells, E. coli-mediated Akt S473 phosphorylation underwent the similar kinetics as IRF3 phosphorylation and was completely abolished in TRAM KO cells (Fig. 9 D) and strongly decreased in SLAMF1-depleted cells (Fig. 9 E). The TBK1-IKKepsilon inhibitor MRT67307 decreased TLR4-mediated Akt phosphorylation in THP-1 cells, whereas the Akt inhibitor MK2206 completely abrogated Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 9 F). Both compounds inhibited bacterial killing in THP-1 cells, especially at the earliest time point (Fig. 9 G). Moreover, coincubation with MRT67307 resulted in the increase of intracellular bacterial number as could be seen by negative values in the percentage of bacterial killing (Fig. 9 G).

Our data on MyD88 silencing in primary human macrophages showed that E. coli-induced Akt S473 phosphorylation was not dependent on MyD88 but was dependent on TRAM (Fig. S7 A). In human macrophages, the kinetics of Akt phosphorylation induced by E. coli particles were much faster and robust than those induced by the TLR2 ligand FSL-1 or the TLR4 ligand LPS (Fig. S7 B). TLR2 and TLR4 ligands were not inducing pAkt much over the background level in THP-1 cells, which were used for bacterial killing assays, and pAkt levels were only modestly affected by SLAMF1 or TRAM silencing (Fig. S7 C). In contrast, THP-1 cells stimulated with E. coli particles showed a 15-20-fold increase in pAkt that were almost lost in cells depleted for TRAM or SLAMF1 (Fig. 9, D and E).

In contrast, we found that human monocytes and macrophages largely expressed SLAMF1 in the intracellular Rab11+ ERC compartment; however, they had weak or no expression on the cell surface. After stimulation by E. coli, SLAMF1 relocalized from ERCs to E. coli- or LPS-containing phagosomes that resembled the previously reported Rab11a-dependent transport of TLR4 and TRAM from ERCs to E. coli phagosomes. Endogenous SLAMF1 was already bound to TRAM before stimulation, and upon E. coli phagocytosis, both proteins were recruited to phagosomes by Rab11 GTPases, with class I Rab11 FIPs as effector molecules. It is known that Rab11 functions as a molecular switch, which cycles between two conformational states: a GTP-bound \"active\" form and a GDP-bound \"inactive\" form. Surface TLR4 interaction with LPS on the E. coli outer membrane induces fast intracellular complex formation, resulting in multiple posttranslational modifications of signaling molecules. We hypothesize that TLR4 signaling results in a shift from a Rab11 GDP-bound to a Rab11 GTP-bound active state. Moreover, previous research has demonstrated that FIPs prefer binding to GTP-bound Rab11. Thus, after the Rab11 GDP/GTP ratio shifts to the GTP-bound state, FIPs would connect cargo to Rab11 vesicles, which would enhance delivery of SLAMF1 and TRAM via class I FIPs from ERCs to E. coli phagosomes."

These data demonstrate that SLAMF1 is a critical regulator of TRAM recruitment to the phagosomes. We were able to map the domain in SLAMF1 involved in the interaction with TRAM to 15 C-terminal amino acids as both deletion of five C-terminal amino acids and substitution of amino acids at positions 321-324 abrogated interaction of SLAMF1 protein with TRAM. The interaction domain in TRAM was located outside the BB loop as TIR-TIR dimerization is not affected, and it was mapped to the N-terminal part of TRAM TIR domain between aa 68-95. We found that mouse SLAMF1ct contains different amino acid sequences at positions corresponding with human 321-324 residues. This resulted in the absence of interaction between mouse SLAMF1 and TRAM, and consequently, LPS- or E. coli-induced IFNbeta expression was not altered in Slamf1-/- BMDMs when compared with WT cells."

Moreover, Akt is involved in the activation of NADPH oxidase by the phosphorylating p47 subunit, which may result in ROS generation needed for bacterial killing. We demonstrate that SLAMF1 and TRAM were required for E. coli-mediated Akt phosphorylation via TBK1-IKKepsilon as well as for the efficient bacterial killing. It is known that TLR2 and TLR4 ligands activate Akt S473 in a MyD88-dependent manner. It should be noted that in contrast with these studies, we have used E. coli particles and found that Akt S473 phosphorylation was TRAM and SLAMF1 dependent.

        "text": "There is accumulating evidence on divergent regulation of TLR4 signaling and gene expression in different species. It is known that humans and old-world monkey species are highly sensitive to LPS with physiological changes induced by a dose at nanograms per kilogram, whereas rodents are highly insensitive to LPS with physiological changes only induced by a dose at milligrams per kilogram. Many therapeutic agents that reduce inflammation and mortality in mouse septic shock models show no clinical benefit for humans. Human monocyte-derived macrophages express much higher levels of IFNbeta mRNA in response to LPS than mouse BMDM or thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages. Our findings support higher LPS-induced secretion of IFNbeta by human macrophages compared with BMDMs. Thus, during evolution, human macrophages must have acquired mechanisms to enhance TLR4-mediated IFNbeta production in response to LPS or, vice versa, mouse cells developed less sensitive response to bacterial LPS. We suggest that SLAMF1-regulated transport of TRAM to the TLR4 signaling complex on bacterial phagosomes could be one of the features specific for human cells, which amplifies the IFNbeta secretion. Thus, human SLAMF1 could potentially be targeted to regulate TLR4-mediated cytokine production in inflammatory conditions."

The second-generation packaging plasmids pMD2.G and psPAX2 were used for producing lentivirus (provided by D. Trono; 12260 and 12259; Addgene). HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the packaging and lentiCRISPRv2 plasmids and then washed after 16 h. The lentivirus-containing supernatants were collected after 48 h and used for transduction of THP-1 WT cells along with protamine sulphate (8 microg/ml final concentration). Transduced THP-1 cells were selected with puromycin (1 mug/ml) for 1 mo and then tested for TRAM protein expression by Western blotting. Lentivirus construct of SLAMF1 was prepared by cloning full-size SLAMF1 with or without Flag tag to the bicistronic lentiviral expression vector pLVX-EF1alpha-IRES-ZsGreen1 (Takara Bio Inc.; primers are listed in Table 1). The construct was sequenced and cotransfected with packaging plasmids (psPAX2 and pMD2.G provided by D. Trono; 12260 and 12259; Addgene) to produce pseudoviral particles in HEK293T cells. Supernatants were collected at 48 and 72 h, combined, and concentrated using Lenti-X concentrator (631231; Takara Bio Inc.). Viral particles were titrated in HEK293T cells. Titrated virus particles, which gave 90-100% of transduction efficiencies, were subsequently used for transduction of primary human macrophages (resulting in 30-40% of ZsGreen-positive cells). Macrophages were infected on day 6 of differentiation, media was changed after 24 h, and stimulation by LPS (100 ng/ml) was performed 72 h after transduction.
