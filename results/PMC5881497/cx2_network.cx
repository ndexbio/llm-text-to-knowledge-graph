We found that SLAMF1 controls trafficking of the Toll receptor-associated molecule (TRAM) from the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) to Escherichia coli phagosomes. In resting macrophages, SLAMF1 is localized to ERC, but upon addition of E. coli, it is trafficked together with TRAM from ERC to E. coli phagosomes in a Rab11-dependent manner. We found that endogenous SLAMF1 protein interacted with TRAM and defined key interaction domains as amino acids 68 to 95 of TRAM as well as 15 C-terminal amino acids of SLAMF1. Interestingly, the SLAMF1-TRAM interaction was observed for human but not mouse proteins.

We found that endogenous SLAMF1 protein interacted with TRAM and defined key interaction domains as amino acids 68 to 95 of TRAM as well as 15 C-terminal amino acids of SLAMF1. Interestingly, the SLAMF1-TRAM interaction was observed for human but not mouse proteins. Overall, our observations suggest that SLAMF1 is a new target for modulation of TLR4-TRAM-TRIF inflammatory signaling in human cells.",

TLR4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria in complex with the coreceptors myeloid differentiation factor 2 and CD14, and it recruits signaling adapters myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and MyD88 adapter-like (Mal). This results in an immediate activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and production of proinflammatory cytokines.

The phosphorylation of STAT1 and the initiation of transcription of IFN-inducible genes like CXCL10 are readouts of IFNbeta binding to the IFNAR.

Human macrophages respond to LPS with at least 10-fold higher IFNbeta mRNA expression compared with mouse BMDMs and thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages. Thus, we wanted to check whether SLAMF1 and TRAM interaction was conserved across species, and we tested murine SLAMF1 and TRAM proteins for interaction. Indeed, mouse TRAMEGFP did not coprecipitate with mouse SLAMF1Flag (Fig. 6 G). Interestingly, three amino acids in human SLAMF1ct upstream of potential TRAM-binding site TNSI (321-324; UniProtKB, Q13291) are different from mouse SLAMF1ct, containing PNPT (329-332; UniProtKB, Q9QUM4; Fig. S6 A). Substitution of the TNSI sequence with PNPT in human SLAMF1 abrogated its interaction with TRAMYFP (Fig. 6 H). Thus, these amino acids are crucial for interaction. However, the sequence in human TRAM involved in the interaction with human SLAMF1 is not fully conserved in murine TRAM (Fig. S6 B), which also could explain why murine TRAM and SLAMF1 do not interact.",

To address this question, HEK cells were cotransfected by SLAMF1Flag, TRAMYFP, and TLR4Cherry or TRIFHA, and their interactions were monitored by co-IP with SLAMF1Flag. Both TLR4Cherry and TRIFHA coprecipitated with SLAMF1Flag in the presence of TRAMYFP (Fig. 8, A and B). In addition, SLAMF1 did not coprecipitate with TLR4Flag in the absence of TRAMYFP (Fig. 8 C). Overexpression of SLAMF1 did not alter the ability of TLR4 to attract TRIF via TRAM despite that SLAMF1 also coprecipitated with the complex in the presence of TRAM and TRIF (Fig. 8 D). Furthermore, TRIF overexpression strongly enhanced SLAMF1 coprecipitation with TLR4Flag (Fig. 8 E).

Monocytes were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% pooled human serum (St. Olavs Hospital) and used within 24 h after isolation. Monocyte-derived macrophages were obtained by differentiating cells for 8-10 d in RPMI 1640 with 10% human serum and 25 ng/ml rhM-CSF (216-MC-025; R&D Systems). THP-1 cells (ATCC) were cultured in RMPI 1640 supplemented by 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 100 nM penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 5 muM beta-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich). THP-1 cells were differentiated with 50 ng/ml of PMA (Sigma-Aldrich) for 72 h, followed by 48 h in medium without PMA. HEK293T cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS. For making the TRAM KO THP-1 cell line, LentiCRISPRv2 plasmid (a gift from F. Zhang; 52961; Addgene) was ligated with 5'-CACCGATGACTTTGGTATCAAACC-3' and 5'-AAACGGTTTGATACCAAAGTCATC-3' for TRAM. Packaging plasmids pMD2.G and psPAX2 were used for producing lentivirus (provided by D. Trono, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; 12260 and 12259; Addgene). HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the packaging and lentiCRISPRv2 plasmids and then washed after 16 h. The lentivirus-containing supernatants were collected after 48 h and used for transduction of THP-1 cells along with 8 microg/ml protamine sulphate. Transduced THP-1 cells were then selected with puromycin (1 mug/ml) for 1 mo and tested for TRAM protein expression by Western blotting. All cell lines were regularly checked for mycoplasma contamination.",

Fluorescence was captured by standard photomultiplier tube detectors (LSM 510 META; ZEISS), stimulated emission depletion hybrid detector, or photomultiplier tube detectors (TCS SP8). Acquisition software for the LSM 510 META was Zen microscope software (2012; ZEISS) and for the TCS SP8 was LAS AF software (4.0.0.11706; Leica Microsystems). Before imaging, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS on ice, and then immunostaining was performed as described previously. In brief, upon fixation, the cells were permeabilized with PEM buffer (80 mM K-Pipes, pH 6.8, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.05% saponin) for 15 min on ice, quenched of free aldehyde groups in 50 mM NH4Cl with 0.05% saponin for 5 min, and blocked in PBS with 20% human serum and 0.05% saponin. The cells were incubated with primary antibody in PBS with 2% human serum and 0.05% saponin overnight at 4 C or for 2 h at RT. Alexa Fluor-labeled secondary antibodies (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific) were incubated for 15 min at RT after three washes in PBS with 0.05% saponin. If double staining was made, cells were sequentially stained by primary antibodies, specific secondary Alexa Fluor-conjugated antibodies, second primary antibodies, and then specific secondary Alexa Fluor-conjugated antibodies. Images of stained cells, washed in PBS with 0.05% saponin and left in PBS, were captured at RT. 3D data were captured with identical settings, which were also adjusted to avoid saturation of voxel (3D pixels) intensities. For colocalization analysis, the Coloc 2 plugin with thresholds in Fiji (ImageJ; National Institutes of Health) application was applied. The pHrodo fluorescence was used to spot or surface render the volume of individual phagosomes when E. coli pHrodo, S. aureus pHrodo red, or AF488-conjugated E. coli particles were used. A binary mask was created around bacterial particles (Process/Make Binary function) and used to define the regions for quantification of MIs for TRAM and SLAMF1 voxels in original images and to quantify E. coli pHrodo particles MI when redirected to the original image. E. coli pHrodo MI was evaluated to quantify acidification of E. coli-containing phagosomes in cells treated by control or SLAMF1 siRNA. For analysis of the sum of voxel intensities of SLAMF1 inside Golgi rings, GM130 staining was used to define the region to evaluate SLAMF1 intensities for individual 3D Golgi ring structure. Using ImageJ/Fiji software, 3D Golgi ring structures were selected as a region of interest (ROI) and used as a mask to obtain a numerical value of the relative amount of SLAMF1 as a sum of voxel intensities for SLAMF1 staining in Golgi ring ROIs from original image. ImarisXT software (Bitplane) was used to surface render the imaged GM130-positive structures, giving one surface for each. The values for voxel intensities did not follow a Gaussian distribution, and therefore we used median as a measure of average intensities and the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test to evaluate statistical significance in Prism (5.03; GraphPad Software).",

Fig. S3 shows that knockdown of SLAMF1 in THP-1 cells impairs TLR4-mediated phosphorylation of TBK1, IRF3, and TAK1 in response to LPS or E. coli particles. Fig. S4 shows that SLAMF1 relocalizes from ERCs to early and late E. coli phagosomes but not to S. aureus phagosomes and that SLAMF1 is required for E. coli phagosome acidification in human cells. Fig. S5 shows that SLAMF1 interaction with TRAM is independent from SLAMF1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Fig. S6 shows that TLR4-mediated IFNbeta and TNF mRNA expression and corresponding cytokine secretion are not altered in Slamf1-/- BMDMs and provides human and murine SLAMF1 and TRAM proteins sequence alignments. Fig. S7 shows that E. coli-mediated Akt phosphorylation in human macrophages is not dependent on MyD88 expression and that TLR2- and TLR4-induced phosphorylation of Akt is weak and not much dependent on SLAMF1 or TRAM expression.",
