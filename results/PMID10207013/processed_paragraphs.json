Cultured human endothelial cells (EC) constitutively expressed MT1-MMP mRNA and protein with enzymatic activity. Tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-la, or interleukin-1\u00df caused a time-dependent increase in the steady-state MT1-MMP mRNA levels within 4 h of exposure, peaking about 4-fold by 6 h, and remaining elevated for 12 h. Increased MT1-MMP mRNA correlated with a 2.5-fold increase in MT1-MMP protein in EC membranes. Ox-LDL also increased MT1-MMP mRNA levels that varied with the duration of exposure and degree of LDL oxidation. The increase in MT1-MMP mRNA occurred within 6 h of exposure to Ox-LDL and peaked over 3-fold by 6 h. Ox-LDL, but not native LDL, increased MT1-MMP protein by 2-fold in EC membranes. A combination of TNF-a and Ox-LDL was additive in increasing MT1-MMP expression. Nuclear run-on assays showed that TNF-a or Ox-LDL augmented steady-state mRNA levels by increased transcription of the MT1-MMP gene. These findings indicate that activation of EC by inflammatory cytokines and/or Ox-LDL increase MT1-MMP expression. Since MT1-MMP promotes matrix degradation by activating pro-MMP-2, these results suggest a novel mechanism whereby cytokines or Ox-LDL may influence extracellular matrix remodeling."

        "text": "The early events in the initiation of atherosclerosis include the migration of blood-borne cells into the subendothelial space and the migration of medial smooth muscle cells into intimal layer of arteries. Localized degradation of extracellular matrix components by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) of endothelial cells (EC) may facilitate the migration of cells observed in early as well as late stages of atherosclerosis. In addition, many episodes of coronary thrombosis, particularly in women and diabetics, occur when endothelial cells slough from the surface of plaques, causing a superficial erosion. Severing the tethers of endothelial cells to the underlying extracellular matrix may favor endothelial desquamation and acute coronary syndromes. Indeed, accumulating evidence indicates that matrix degradation mediated by locally produced MMPs may contribute to the genesis and progression of atherosclerotic lesions and to the development of intimal lesions in experimental arterial injury."

        "text": "Matrix metalloproteinases require activation from a latent zymogen form to attain their enzymatic activity. Cultured EC constitutively secrete precursor MMP-2, which when activated can participate in the degradation of interstitial collagen, an important constituent of the vascular extracellular matrix. Collagenolysis by endothelial cells may contribute to infiltration of inflammatory cells and angiogenesis during evolution of the atherosclerotic plaque. Importantly, MMP-2 (also known as collagenase IV) can degrade type IV collagen, an important component of the basement membrane to which endothelial cells attach. The mechanism underlying the activation of MMP-2 remains uncertain. The recently discovered MT1-MMP seems an important candidate because it can activate latent MMP-2 in vitro. In addition, as a membrane-bound rather than -soluble molecule, MT1-MMP might participate in activation of precursor MMP-2 in a localized manner. EC covering atherosclerotic lesions are exposed to both inflammatory cytokines and oxidized low density lipoproteins. To understand the nature and regulation of the factor(s) that promote activation of MMP-2 from its precursor, this study investigated whether cytokines and Ox-LDL regulate expression of MT1-MMP by cultured vascular EC and whether they endow EC with the capacity to activate pro-MMP-2."

A polymerase chain reaction product of the expected size (171 base pairs) was identified and cloned into the pCRII vector. The DNA sequence of the amplified fragment revealed a complete identity to the human MT1-MMP cDNA sequence and showed homologies to other published MT-MMP cDNA sequences. Northern blotting assays using this cloned cDNA fragment as a probe showed that EC contain a single mRNA species of 4.5 kb, a size similar to that of MT1-MMP mRNA observed in normal lung tissue and tumor cells."

Both cytokines and Ox-LDL caused a time-dependent progressive increase in the steady state levels of MT1-MMP mRNA in stimulated EC. MT1-MMP mRNA levels increased within 4 h of exposure to TNF-a, reached a peak level of about 4-fold above control by 6 h, and remained elevated for at least 12 h. The effect of Ox-LDL on the levels of MT1-MMP mRNA depended on the degree of LDL oxidation as measured by presence of the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). Ox-LDL with TBARS ranging from 2.6 to 13.4 nmol/mg of LDL protein caused increase in steady-state MT1-MMP mRNA levels as compared with native LDL (TBARS = 0.2 nmol/mg). Ox-LDL with higher TBARS up to 24.2 nmol/mg LDL protein also increased the levels of MT1-MMP mRNA in EC, although to a lesser extent than Ox-LDL with 7.3 TBARS. The time course for the induction of MT1-MMP mRNA in response to Ox-LDL appeared similar to TNF-a. MT1-MMP mRNA levels increased and peaked at 6 h of exposure and remained elevated for at least 24 h. Treatment of EC for 8 h with a combination of TNF-a (10 ng/ml) and Ox-LDL (100 \u00b5g/ml) increased the levels of MT1-MMP mRNA in an additive manner."

To examine whether an increase in steady state levels of MT1-MMP mRNA in response to TNF-a or Ox-LDL was associated with the increased rate of MT1-MMP gene transcription, we performed run-on assays on isolated nuclei. The basal level of MT1-MMP gene transcription in EC increased about 2-3-fold when cells were stimulated with TNF-a. Ox-LDL also caused about similar increase in the rate of MT1-MMP gene transcription. The transcription of \u00df-tubulin, a constitutively expressed cytoskeletal protein gene, remained unchanged in response to either TNF-a or Ox-LDL."

Incubation of medium conditioned by human smooth muscle cells that contained pro-MMP-2, with plasma membrane extracts prepared from EC treated with TNF-a, interleukin-18, or Ox-LDL, increased the proteolytic conversion of 72-kDa pro-MMP-2 to new gelatinolytic bands of 70- and 68-kDa corresponding to the processed active MMP-2.

We found that exposure of EC to Ox-LDL appreciably increases the steady-state levels of MT1-MMP mRNA. Cytokines released by inflammatory cells or induced in vascular cells by Ox-LDL, mediators relevant to vascular pathology, progressively increased MT1-MMP transcription by cultured EC. The augmented MT1-MMP mRNA correlated with increased plasma membrane-associated immunoreactive protein and catalytic function of precursor MMP-2, an activity ascribed to this enzyme.

Since MT1-MMP belongs to a family of enzymes containing at least four members, the residual activity that partially converts pro-MMP-2 to MMP-2 after immunodepletion of MT1-MMP in our assays may derive from other members of the family or from related enzymes present in endothelial membrane extracts."

        "text": "Activated MT1-MMP acts on several substrates of potential relevance to vascular pathobiology. The catalytic domain of MT1-MMP activates pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-2\u00b7tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 complex. The trimolecular complex of MT1-MMP\u00b7tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2\u00b7pro-MMP-2 functions as an activated form of MT1-MMP and thus provides a mechanism for spatially regulated matrix degradation. MT1-MMP can also process pro-MMP-13 (procollagenase-3) to the fully active enzyme. Precursor MMP-2 potentiates activation of pro-MMP-13 by MT1-MMP, and active MMP-13 can in turn activate MMP-2 and MMP-g zymogens, thereby indicating an activation cascade of three members of the MMP family. Thus, increased expression of MT1-MMP can favor digestion of native interstitial collagens by MMP-13, continued degradation of partially degraded collagens due to gelatinase activity of MMP-2, and proteolysis of basement membrane collagen (type IV) and elastin by active MMP-2."

        "text": "The ability of endothelial cells to produce MT1-MMP, and hence activate the spectrum of proteases described above may have several important functional consequences in vascular pathophysiology, including angiogenesis, leukocyte transmigration, and plaque disruptions that cause thrombosis, the dreaded complication of atherosclerotic vascular diseases. Proteolysis plays an important role in migration of EC inside tissues during vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Transmigration of leukocytes through the endothelium and subjacent basement membrane is a key process in normal host defenses, in inflammatory conditions, and in many vascular diseases including atherosclerosis. Activation of MMP-2 by endothelial MT1-MMP may promote these processes, since MMP-2 degrades basement membrane collagen type IV. In addition, active MMP-2 may promote local endothelial desquamation by lysing contacts with the basement membrane, causing superficial erosion of atherosclerotic plaques, now thought often to provoke coronary thrombosis and sudden death, particularly in women and diabetics. Indeed, areas of such superficial erosion of atheroma exhibit augmented expression of MMP-2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2, which combine with MT1-MMP to form the active ternary complex. Another common pathway of atherosclerotic plaque disruption and thrombosis involves rupture of the atheroma's cap which depends on interstitial collagen for its tensile strength. Activation of pro-MMP-13 by endothelial MT1-MMP may contribute to this mechanism of plaque disruption and consequent thrombosis."
