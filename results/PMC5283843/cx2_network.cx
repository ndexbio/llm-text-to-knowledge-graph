                "description": "The Complement System in Neuropathic and Postoperative Pain, Certain types of pain are major unmet medical needs that affect more than 8 percent of the population. Neuropathic pain can be caused by many pathogenic processes including injury, autoimmune disease, neurological disease, endocrine dysfunction, infection, toxin exposure, and substance abuse and is frequently resistant to available pain therapies. The same can be said of postsurgical pain, which can arise from uncontrolled inflammation around the wound site. The complement system is part of the innate immune system and can both initiate and sustain acute and chronic inflammatory pain. Here we review the complement system and original investigations that identify potential drug targets within this system. Drugs that act to inhibit the complement system could fill major gaps in our current standard of care for neuropathic pain states.",

Administration of complement C3a into the cerebral ventricles of mice inhibited analgesia induced by morphine. The kappa opioid agonist U-50488H produced analgesia in the hotplate and the tail pinch tests after systemic injection (30 mg/kg subcutaneous). The analgesic effect of U-50488H was completely reversed by the intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of C3a at 10, but not 3 pmoles. Drugs acting at the delta opioid receptor produce robust analgesic effects. Analgesia was observed by Jinsmaa and colleagues when mice were injected with 3 pmoles (ICV) of the selective delta receptor agonist peptide DTLET (Tyr-D-Thr-Gly-Phe-Leu-Thr), but this effect was not antagonized by C3a at doses up to 10 pmoles ICV. The selectivity for mu (morphine) and kappa (U-50488H) over delta (DTLET) receptors demonstrates that the effect of C3a was specific. It was later demonstrated that a C3a fragment (YPLPR) could bind to the mu opioid in addition to the C3a receptor. The tyrosine variant of this peptide (WPLPR), however, could still reverse opioid analgesic effects despite its complete absence of affinity for the opioid receptor. This suggests a direct effect of theC3a receptor to block endogenous analgesic activity, and that a selective C3a antagonist might have novel and useful analgesic properties.",

In the Randall-Selitto test (the paw pressure test), rats were injected in the hindpaw with known complement activators, zymosan; carrageenan, or lipopolysaccharide. Then nociception was measured after pressure was applied using an electronic pressure meter. They found that injection of PMX53, either before or after injection of zymosan, reduced hypernociception. PMX53 injection also lowered hypernociception caused by ovalbumin injection into the hind paw. They noted that PMX53 injection inhibited neutrophil migration caused by zymosan, but not that caused by carrageen or LPS. Treatment of the rats with the immunosuppressant anticancer microtubule disruptor vinblastine before injection of C5a, zymosan, or carrageen both blocked neutrophil migration and reduced hypernociception. Finally, they noted that treatment with PMX53 did not affect the levels of TNF-alpha or IL-1beta. From this, they concluded that the role of C5a in inflammatory hypernociception does not involve the production of hypernociceptive cytokines, but does require the presence of neutrophils.",

In the Randall-Selitto test (the paw pressure test), rats were injected in the hindpaw with known complement activators, zymosan; carrageenan, or lipopolysaccharide. Then nociception was measured after pressure was applied using an electronic pressure meter. They found that injection of PMX53, either before or after injection of zymosan, reduced hypernociception. PMX53 injection also lowered hypernociception caused by ovalbumin injection into the hind paw. They noted that PMX53 injection inhibited neutrophil migration caused by zymosan, but not that caused by carrageen or LPS. Treatment of the rats with the immunosuppressant anticancer microtubule disruptor vinblastine before injection of C5a, zymosan, or carrageen both blocked neutrophil migration and reduced hypernociception.

Repeating experiments with C5aR-/- mice and mice treated with PMX53 (see above), they found that both heat and mechanical related hyperalgesia were reduced in C5aR knockout mice, and by wild type mice treated with the C5aR inhibitor PMX53. Then they found that the heat related hyperalgesia caused by C5a injection into mouse hind paws was significantly reduced in TRPV1 (transient receptor potentialcation channels vanilloid) knockout mice, and in mice treated with the TRPV1 antagonist AMG9810. TRPV1 has been implicated in nociceptive pain. They were able to show that in skin, C5aR was found almost entirely in macrophages.
