A POSH mutant that is unable to bind Akt2 (POSH W489A) exhibits enhanced binding to MLK3, and this increase in binding is accompanied by increased activation of the JNK signaling pathway. In addition, we show that the association of MLK3 with POSH is increased upon inhibition of the endogenous phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. Thus, the assembly of an active JNK signaling complex by POSH is negatively regulated by Akt2. Further, the level of Akt-phosphorylated MLK3 is reduced in cells expressing the Akt2 binding domain of POSH, which acts as a dominant interfering protein. Taken together, our results support a model in which Akt2 binds to a POSH-MLK-MKK-JNK complex and phosphorylates MLK3; phosphorylation of MLK3 by Akt2 results in the disassembly of the JNK complex bound to POSH and down-regulation of the JNK signaling pathway."

The three family members, Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3, contain an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a central kinase domain, and a C-terminal regulatory domain. Binding of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) lipid product PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 to the PH domain leads to membrane localization and a conformational change that facilitates the phosphorylation of two key regulatory sites, T308 and S473 of Akt1 and T309 and S474 of Akt2. Multiple substrates for the Akt kinases have been identified and include glycogen synthase kinase a/B, Raf-1, and B-Raf, mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4, also SEK1), apoptosis signal-regulated kinase 1 (ASK1), and forkhead transcription factors."

The JNK signaling pathway is a mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade in which a MAPKKK activates a MAPKK, which then activates a MAPK, JNK. MAPKKKs for the JNK signaling pathway include mixed-lineage kinases (MLKs; MLK1-3, DLK), MEK kinase 1, and ASK1. The MAPKKKs signal through MKK4 and MKK7. MKK4/7 phosphorylate and activate JNK1-3. JNKs phosphorylate and activate the transcriptional activity of c-Jun. The JNK signaling pathway is activated in response to cytokines and environmental stress. In addition, activated Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 can stimulate the JNK MAPK cascade."

Second, Akt phosphorylates and negatively regulates the MAPKK MKK4. In addition, Akt interacts with the JNK interacting protein 1 (JIP1) scaffold and inhibits the ability of JIP1 to form active JNK signaling complexes. The binding of Akt to JIP1 is isoform specific; Akt1 but not Akt2 interacts with JIP1. Thus, Akt can inhibit one or more steps within the JNK signaling pathway, depending on the complement of components that form the functional JNK signaling module."

Studies in mammalian cells demonstrated that ectopic expression of POSH activated the JNK pathway and promoted nuclear translocation of NF-KB. POSH has four SH3 domains. The first two SH3 domains activate the JNK pathway; the second two SH3 domains promote NF-KB translocation. The translocation of NF-KB was observed in POSH injected cells as well as in adjacent, uninjected cells, suggesting that POSH regulates NF-KB translocation indirectly. A subsequent study demonstrated that POSH could bind MLKs (MLK1-3, DLK) and complex with MKK4/7 and JNK1/2. Thus POSH links activated Rac with the JNK kinase cascade and facilitates the formation of a functional JNK signaling module."

Akt2 interacts with the third SH3 domain of POSH. A POSH mutant that is unable to bind Akt2 exhibits increased binding to MLK3. This increased binding of MLK3 to POSH is accompanied by increased activation of the JNK signaling pathway. Consistent with this observation, we find that the association of MLK3 with POSH is increased when the endogenous PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is inhibited with LY294002. These results indicate that the assembly of an active JNK signaling complex by POSH is negatively regulated by Akt2. Further, the level of Akt-phosphorylated MLK3 is reduced in cells ectopically expressing the Akt2 binding domain of POSH, which acts as a dominant interfering protein. Taken together, these results support a model in which the functional consequence of Akt2 binding to the POSH scaffold is to promote the disassembly of the complex, in part, through Akt-mediated phosphorylation of the MAPKKK MLK3."

POSH interacts with activated Rac and has been suggested to function as a scaffold protein for Rac-mediated signaling events.

Mutation of this residue disrupts a salt bridge with an Arg of the ligand and also disorders the ligand-binding pocket of the SH3 domain. Another highly conserved residue within the ligand-binding pocket of the SH3 domain is a Trp that forms a hydrogen bond with a Pro in the Pro-X-X-Pro motif common to many ligands recognized by SH3 domains. To determine if these residues, which are conserved in POSH, mediate the association of POSH with Akt2, two mutated SH3-3 domains, POSH E470Q and POSH W489A, were generated for protein-protein interaction studies. POSH E470Q and POSH W489A exhibit greatly diminished binding to Akt2 in yeast two-hybrid assays, and in pull-down assays in HEK293 cells.

Site 1, with a basic residue at position -3, would be a class I SH3 ligand (consensus, R/KXXPXXP). In class I SH3 ligands, the basic residue forms a salt bridge with an acidic residue in the SH3 domain. Two N-terminal lysines are located upstream of site 2 (Lys-420, Lys-421) but neither is in the position of the basic residue in a consensus class I SH3 ligand. In addition, site 2 does not meet the consensus for a class II SH3 ligand (consensus, PXXPXR/K) because it lacks a basic residue C-terminal to the Pro-X-X-Pro motif. Examples of SH3 domains that prefer ligands without basic residues adjacent to the Pro-X-X-Pro motif include the Abl SH3 domain (which binds to YPPPPIP) and the P5 (third) SH3 domain of p68 (which binds to PLPP-PAP)."

The requirement for Glu-470 underscores the importance of the ligand binding pocket of the POSH SH3 domain in interacting with Akt2. In addition, Glu-470 may also strengthen the interaction between POSH and the N-terminal Pro-X-X-Pro motif in Akt2 by contacting the Arg positioned before the Pro-X-X-Pro motif. In the CSK SH3 domain, Trp-47 (the equivalent of Trp-489 of POSH) is predicted to make a hydrogen bond contact with a Pro of the Pro-X-X-Pro motif.

Three of four basic residues found in the Akt1 VL2 are conserved in Akt2. So, binding of Akt2 to POSH may prolong or sustain the active, open conformation of Akt2 to facilitate the phosphorylation of kinase substrates complexed with POSH. Kim et al. recently reported that JIP1, which acts as an Akt1 scaffold, regulates the enzymatic activity of Akt1. Experiments are in progress to determine whether the levels of active Akt2 are increased by ectopic expression of POSH."

Mutation of this motif resulted in an Akt1 mutant protein that failed to bind to Src and could not be phosphorylated on Y315, suggesting that the interaction between the SH3 domain of Src and this proline-rich motif in Akt1 is required for tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent activation of Akt1 catalytic activity.
