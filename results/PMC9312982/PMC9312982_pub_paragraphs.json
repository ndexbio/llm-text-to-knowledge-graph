        "text": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are one of the most studied groups of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns. TLRs provide protection against both external and internal threats by initiating a pro-inflammatory response as well as activating and guiding the adaptive immune system to mount effector responses that will eliminate and/or ameliorate the problem. Dysfunction or dysregulation of TLR responses can have dire consequences for the host, such as increased susceptibility to infection or excessive life-threatening inflammation. Thus, understanding how these receptors operate holds great potential for guiding preventive measures as well as the development of better treatments and new drugs for infectious and autoimmune diseases, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Through the years, some TLRs have received more attention than others, often due to the availability of easily accessible models and their convenience for study, but with technological and scientific advances, this gap is closing. TLR8 provides a classic example of a less-studied TLR as it is non-functional in rodents and, thus, application of murine models/KOs is limited."

It has also been implicated in regulating TLR-mediated responses, although the reports are divergent, with evidence of both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects. Aksoy et al., found that in human monocyte-derived DCs, PI3K negatively regulated the expression of IFNbeta in TRIF-dependent signaling downstream of TLR3 and TLR4, whereas Guiducci et al., found PI3K-Akt necessary for nuclear translocation of IRF7 and expression of TLR7 and TLR9-induced type I IFNs in human plasmacytoid predendritic cells.

However, Bonham et al., have shown that TIRAP is also capable of binding other phosphoinositides, PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2, on endosomal membranes, and mediates signaling from endosomal TLR7 and TLR9 in murine cells. Recently, some evidence of TIRAP involvement in signaling from TLR7 and TLR9 in human cells was provided by Leszczynska et al., and Zyzak et al..

To address this, we performed TIRAP silencing in human primary MDMs prior to stimulation with the thiazoquinoline compound CL075, which is a synthetic ligand specific for TLR8 in human monocytes and MDMs. Analysis of cytokine mRNA expression following TLR8 stimulation in TIRAP-silenced cells showed a significant reduction in IFNbeta and IL-12A mRNA expression, with the most significant effect on IL-12A expression (Figure 1). Of the pro-inflammatory cytokines assessed following TLR8 stimulation, TIRAP silencing only affected TNF mRNA expression, both at two hours and four hours (Figure 1). TLR2 and TLR4 stimulation was conducted in parallel, since TIRAP is an important bridging adaptor for these TLRs. Indeed, TIRAP silencing led to decreased TNF, IL-6, IL-1beta, IL-12A, and IL-12B mRNA expression following TLR2 and TLR4 stimulation (Figure S1a,b). TLR2 did not induce IFNbeta mRNA expression or secretion in human MDMs, in agreement with earlier studies. Notably, in the case of TLR2 and TLR4 stimulation, we have not observed a significant effect on the early induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Figure S1a,b), which could be due to the still-sufficient amount of residual TIRAP protein for the initiation of signaling, despite a marked decrease in TIRAP-protein expression in silenced MDMs (Figure S1c)."

However, there was a noticeable change in TLR4 signaling in TIRAP KO THP-1 cells from two weeks (early) to four weeks (late) of cultivation in puromycin-selection medium (Figure S2a,b). TLR4-mediated IFNbeta expression was inhibited in early TIRAP KO cells, while the effect was lost after prolonged cultivation (Figure S2a,b). The response to LPS in TIRAP-silenced THP-1 cells was more comparable to early TIRAP KO cells (Figure S2a,c).

        "text": "TLR8 can sense ssRNA of bacterial origin. Given how common bacterial infections are, and the potential serious consequences associated with them, it is essential to understand the mechanistic interactions between the pathogen and immune cells. Group B streptococcus (S. agalactiae, GBS) and S. aureus are commensal bacteria but hold great invasive potential and can cause serious infections. TLR8 was recently shown to be involved in the innate immune responses to these Gram-positive bacteria but had less impact on responses to Gram-negative bacteria. As such, we wanted to address the importance of TIRAP in the TLR8-mediated responses to GBS and S. aureus. TIRAP-silenced primary MDMs were stimulated with TLR4 ligand LPS or TLR8 ligand CL075, or infected with clinical isolates of E. coli, GBS, or S. aureus, for a total of four hours and at two bacterial doses. Expression of IFNbeta, TNF, IL-12A, IL-12B, and IL-6 mRNA was analyzed by RT-qPCR (Figure 3). In accordance with our previous findings, successful TIRAP silencing reduced the expression of these cytokines following LPS treatment and infection by E. coli (Figure 3). TIRAP silencing also significantly reduced IL-12A mRNA expression following GBS infection, with a similar tendency for IFNbeta induction, although statistical support was not achieved (Figure 3). These results indicated a clear effect of TIRAP silencing on TLR8-mediated IL-12A expression, with a similar yet non-significant trend for IFNbeta mRNA (Figure 1 and Figure 3). In S. aureus-infected cells, TIRAP silencing significantly reduced IL-6 and TNF mRNA expression, which could reflect the inhibition of TLR2-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling in TIRAP-silenced cells (Figure 3). We observed non-significant trends in the reduction in IFNbeta, IL-12A, or IL-12B mRNA expression, following an S. aureus challenge (Figure 3). S. aureus is sensed both by TLR2 and TLR8, and TLR2 activation can suppress TLR8-IRF5-mediated induction of IFNbeta and IL-12A, and it is possible that the combined TLR2 and TLR8 activation can diminish the requirement for TIRAP in the TLR8 mediated responses to S. aureus. Additional sensing mechanisms of whole live bacteria are also involved, such as complement and Fc receptors. These might compensate for the loss of TIRAP in our experiments, thus explaining the relatively small effects upon a bacterial challenge compared to pure TLR8-agonist stimulation. Thus, a kinetic study would be required to further clarify the impact of TIRAP in the sensing of live bacteria. Moreover, gene silencing has limitations, since it does not completely abrogate the expression or protein level of the silenced gene (Figure S3). Altogether, these results indicate that TIRAP can influence IRF5-mediated TLR8 signaling also during bacterial infection, which is especially clear for the induction of IL-12A expression by GBS."

Lysates of LPS-stimulated cells were included as a negative control since TLR4 signaling does not trigger IRF5 translocation in human MDMs, but rather it activates the IRF3-transcriptional factor in a TRAM/TRIF-dependent manner. No clear alterations in the phosphorylation pattern of IRF5 or p65 in TIRAP-silenced cells after CL075 stimulation were revealed (Figure S4).

This is in line with the concept of the direct interaction of endosomal TLRs with the signaling adaptor MyD88. TIRAP may, thus, not be required for connecting MyD88 to TLR8 to initiate the signaling but is rather recruited to the activated TLR8-signaling complex, and, thus, subsequently regulate downstream signaling.

Silencing of TIRAP had some inhibitory effect on TLR8-mediated TAK1 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, while not affecting IRAK1 posttranslational modifications or the degradation of IkappaBalpha (Figure 6a,b). Indeed, de-phosphorylation of TAK1 in TIRAP-silenced cells was faster when compared to control cells upon CL075 stimulation (Figure 6a,b), which may indicate a possible role of TIRAP in the stabilization of IRAK1/TABs/TAK1 signaling complex and increased TAK1-mediated cytokine production."

The most consistent effect of TIRAP silencing upon the ligation of TLR8 across PBMCs from several donors was the decreased phosphorylation of Akt, particularly 45-60 min after TLR8 activation (Figure 6a,b), which correlates with the timeframe when TIRAP is recruited to the TLR8-induced Myddosome (Figure 5). These results indicate that TLR8 signaling may be coupled to the PI3K/Akt pathway, and that TIRAP positively regulates TLR8-mediated activation of Akt (Figure 6a,b).

In contrast, TAK1 kinase inhibitor (5z-7-oxozeaenol) blocked IRF5 translocation, but not p65 translocation, while inhibiting IKKbeta with a IKKII-VIII inhibitor that blocked both p65 and IRF5 translocation, as shown in our earlier study. These data suggest that decreased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK does not explain the reduction in IRF5 nuclear translocation upon TIRAP silencing. Still, inhibition of p38 MAPK strongly inhibited the expression of IFNbeta and TNF mRNA in 2 h of CL075 stimulation, similar to TAK1 inhibition (Figure S6b). Since p65 nuclear translocation was not affected by the p38 MAPK inhibitor, this could be explained by attenuation of the AP-1 transcriptional complex activity in BIRB796-treated cells, which would result in reduced cytokine induction according to the established role for AP-1 in cytokines' promoter activity. Overall, we conclude that TIRAP may regulate TLR8 signaling via two distinct pathways: an Akt pathway and the TAK1 pathway that enhances p38 MAPK activation. Both pathways contribute to cytokine induction. The regulation of IFNbeta and IL-12A expression by modulation of nuclear IRF5 levels is the most marked effect of TIRAP silencing, which could not be explained by the decreased p38 MAPK activation in silenced cells.

We have recently demonstrated that TLR8 is a dominant TLR in the response to the Gram-positive bacteria, such as GBS and S. aureus, in human primary monocytes and MDMs. We, therefore, addressed the contribution of TIRAP in the response to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections in MDMs and revealed a partial dependency of TIRAP in the regulation of cytokine production with all the examined bacteria. The impact of TIRAP in E. coli-induced cytokine production could be mainly attributed to LPS-activated TLR4-signaling, while a partial reduction in TNF and IL-6 production induced by S. aureus may involve TLR2 signaling. Genetic TIRAP deficiency in humans impairs both TLR4 and TLR2 signaling, though the TLR2-response in macrophages and susceptibility to S. aureus infections can be rescued in vivo by lipoteichoic acid (LTA)-specific IgG antibodies, likely due to a compensatory mechanism via Fc-receptor (CD32) engagement. We have shown earlier that the GBS-induced cytokine production in myeloid cell cultures is almost entirely TLR8-mediated, and the significant reduction in IL-12A expression, thus, demonstrates a role of TLR8-TIRAP signaling during a challenge with a viable Gram-positive bacterium. Even though induction of IL-12A and IFNbeta by the Gram-positive bacteria is mainly TLR8 dependent, our data only revealed a tendency of attenuated IFNbeta expression after TIRAP silencing, which did not reach statistical support, possibly due to underpowered statistics. It is also possible that the selected time point for gene-expression analysis was sub-optimal, or that the triggering of several signaling mechanism by the whole live bacteria (e.g., TLR2, TLR8, Fc-receptors, complement receptors, etc.) could compensate for the reduced TIRAP levels. Moreover, considerable levels of TIRAP protein remain in the cells after TIRAP silencing. The effect of TIRAP silencing was more prominent for TLR2 and TLR4 signaling with prolonged stimulation, which may imply that the levels of TIRAP in silenced cells are sufficient to initiate proximal signaling but not to sustain the cytokine production. Generation of TIRAP KO THP-1 cells was done as an alternative strategy, but the phenotype appeared unstable, possibly due to compensatory signaling mechanisms. Thus, the real contribution of TIRAP to TLR8-mediated cytokine induction might be more prominent, both for purified agonists and whole bacteria, and this issue, thus, warrants further studies."

MDMs (5-6 donors in consecutive experiments) were pre-treated with TIRAP siRNA or control oligo and incubated with LPS (100 ng/mL), CL075 (1 microg/mL), or live bacteria (GBS 248, SAU 17-2, and ECO 18-1) for a total time of four hours. The doses of bacteria were 1 x 105/mL (e5) and 1 x 106/mL (e6). This roughly corresponds to MOI 0.01 and 0.1 for GBS, MOI 0.02 and 0.2 for SAU, and MOI 0.1 and 1.0 for ECO. Gene expression was determined by RT-qPCR, normalized to untreated sample, and presented as a mean relative fold change +SEM. Statistical testing was done with 2-way RM-ANOVA and post-test (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001)."

Endogenous TIRAP was immunoprecipitated for four hours from lysates (whole cell lysates:WCLs) of human MDMs: untreated or stimulated by LPS (100 ng/mL) or CL075 (2 microg/mL) for indicated time. LPS stimulation was applied as a positive control for TIRAP recruitment to the activated Myddosome. Cellular lysates were analyzed in parallel to control for input, with WB for MyD88, IRAK1, IRAK4, and TIRAP. A representative experiment is shown from a total of four consecutive experiments with different donors."

Western blot analysis of cytosolic fraction and nuclear extracts from cells pre-treated with MK-2206 (2 microM) was followed by stimulation with CL075 (2 microg/mL) or LPS (100 ng/mL). LPS stimulation was applied for negative control. IRF5 levels in nuclear extracts were normalized based on Histone 3 bands' intensity (graph), while GAPDH Western blot was performed to control for potential contamination of nuclear extracts with cytosol content. To control for Akt inhibition efficacy, Akt (S473) phosphorylation level was addressed in WCLs (whole cell lysates) from parallel wells. Representative of three consecutive experiments."
