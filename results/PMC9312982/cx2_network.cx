Group B streptococcus (S. agalactiae, GBS) and S. aureus are commensal bacteria but hold great invasive potential and can cause serious infections. TLR8 was recently shown to be involved in the innate immune responses to these Gram-positive bacteria but had less impact on responses to Gram-negative bacteria. As such, we wanted to address the importance of TIRAP in the TLR8-mediated responses to GBS and S. aureus. TIRAP-silenced primary MDMs were stimulated with TLR4 ligand LPS or TLR8 ligand CL075, or infected with clinical isolates of E. coli, GBS, or S. aureus, for a total of four hours and at two bacterial doses. Expression of IFNbeta, TNF, IL-12A, IL-12B, and IL-6 mRNA was analyzed by RT-qPCR (Figure 3). In accordance with our previous findings, successful TIRAP silencing reduced the expression of these cytokines following LPS treatment and infection by E. coli (Figure 3). TIRAP silencing also significantly reduced IL-12A mRNA expression following GBS infection, with a similar tendency for IFNbeta induction, although statistical support was not achieved (Figure 3).

S. aureus is sensed both by TLR2 and TLR8, and TLR2 activation can suppress TLR8-IRF5-mediated induction of IFNbeta and IL-12A, and it is possible that the combined TLR2 and TLR8 activation can diminish the requirement for TIRAP in the TLR8 mediated responses to S. aureus. Additional sensing mechanisms of whole live bacteria are also involved, such as complement and Fc receptors. These might compensate for the loss of TIRAP in our experiments, thus explaining the relatively small effects upon a bacterial challenge compared to pure TLR8-agonist stimulation. Thus, a kinetic study would be required to further clarify the impact of TIRAP in the sensing of live bacteria. Moreover, gene silencing has limitations, since it does not completely abrogate the expression or protein level of the silenced gene (Figure S3).

Given how common bacterial infections are, and the potential serious consequences associated with them, it is essential to understand the mechanistic interactions between the pathogen and immune cells. Group B streptococcus (S. agalactiae, GBS) and S. aureus are commensal bacteria but hold great invasive potential and can cause serious infections. TLR8 was recently shown to be involved in the innate immune responses to these Gram-positive bacteria but had less impact on responses to Gram-negative bacteria. As such, we wanted to address the importance of TIRAP in the TLR8-mediated responses to GBS and S. aureus. TIRAP-silenced primary MDMs were stimulated with TLR4 ligand LPS or TLR8 ligand CL075, or infected with clinical isolates of E. coli, GBS, or S. aureus, for a total of four hours and at two bacterial doses. Expression of IFNbeta, TNF, IL-12A, IL-12B, and IL-6 mRNA was analyzed by RT-qPCR (Figure 3). In accordance with our previous findings, successful TIRAP silencing reduced the expression of these cytokines following LPS treatment and infection by E. coli (Figure 3). TIRAP silencing also significantly reduced IL-12A mRNA expression following GBS infection, with a similar tendency for IFNbeta induction, although statistical support was not achieved (Figure 3). These results indicated a clear effect of TIRAP silencing on TLR8-mediated IL-12A expression, with a similar yet non-significant trend for IFNbeta mRNA (Figure 1 and Figure 3). In S. aureus-infected cells, TIRAP silencing significantly reduced IL-6 and TNF mRNA expression, which could reflect the inhibition of TLR2-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling in TIRAP-silenced cells (Figure 3). We observed non-significant trends in the reduction in IFNbeta, IL-12A, or IL-12B mRNA expression, following an S. aureus challenge (Figure 3). S. aureus is sensed both by TLR2 and TLR8, and TLR2 activation can suppress TLR8-IRF5-mediated induction of IFNbeta and IL-12A, and it is possible that the combined TLR2 and TLR8 activation can diminish the requirement for TIRAP in the TLR8 mediated responses to S. aureus. Additional sensing mechanisms of whole live bacteria are also involved, such as complement and Fc receptors. These might compensate for the loss of TIRAP in our experiments, thus explaining the relatively small effects upon a bacterial challenge compared to pure TLR8-agonist stimulation. Thus, a kinetic study would be required to further clarify the impact of TIRAP in the sensing of live bacteria. Moreover, gene silencing has limitations, since it does not completely abrogate the expression or protein level of the silenced gene (Figure S3). Altogether, these results indicate that TIRAP can influence IRF5-mediated TLR8 signaling also during bacterial infection, which is especially clear for the induction of IL-12A expression by GBS.",

To evaluate the potential regulation of IRF5 phosphorylation by TIRAP, we performed electrophoresis using Phos-tag gel (Figure S4), since efficient phospho-IRF5 antibodies are not commercially available. Lysates of LPS-stimulated cells were included as a negative control since TLR4 signaling does not trigger IRF5 translocation in human MDMs, but rather it activates the IRF3-transcriptional factor in a TRAM/TRIF-dependent manner. No clear alterations in the phosphorylation pattern of IRF5 or p65 in TIRAP-silenced cells after CL075 stimulation were revealed (Figure S4). Thus, TIRAP expression positively regulated the nuclear translocation of IRF5 downstream to TLR8 (Figure 4), while having no effect on p65 phosphorylation or nuclear translocation (Figure S4).",

We have recently demonstrated that TLR8 is a dominant TLR in the response to the Gram-positive bacteria, such as GBS and S. aureus, in human primary monocytes and MDMs. We, therefore, addressed the contribution of TIRAP in the response to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections in MDMs and revealed a partial dependency of TIRAP in the regulation of cytokine production with all the examined bacteria. The impact of TIRAP in E. coli-induced cytokine production could be mainly attributed to LPS-activated TLR4-signaling, while a partial reduction in TNF and IL-6 production induced by S. aureus may involve TLR2 signaling. Genetic TIRAP deficiency in humans impairs both TLR4 and TLR2 signaling, though the TLR2-response in macrophages and susceptibility to S. aureus infections can be rescued in vivo by lipoteichoic acid (LTA)-specific IgG antibodies, likely due to a compensatory mechanism via Fc-receptor (CD32) engagement. We have shown earlier that the GBS-induced cytokine production in myeloid cell cultures is almost entirely TLR8-mediated, and the significant reduction in IL-12A expression, thus, demonstrates a role of TLR8-TIRAP signaling during a challenge with a viable Gram-positive bacterium. Even though induction of IL-12A and IFNbeta by the Gram-positive bacteria is mainly TLR8 dependent, our data only revealed a tendency of attenuated IFNbeta expression after TIRAP silencing, which did not reach statistical support, possibly due to underpowered statistics. It is also possible that the selected time point for gene-expression analysis was sub-optimal, or that the triggering of several signaling mechanism by the whole live bacteria (e.g., TLR2, TLR8, Fc-receptors, complement receptors, etc.) could compensate for the reduced TIRAP levels. Moreover, considerable levels of TIRAP protein remain in the cells after TIRAP silencing. The effect of TIRAP silencing was more prominent for TLR2 and TLR4 signaling with prolonged stimulation, which may imply that the levels of TIRAP in silenced cells are sufficient to initiate proximal signaling but not to sustain the cytokine production. Generation of TIRAP KO THP-1 cells was done as an alternative strategy, but the phenotype appeared unstable, possibly due to compensatory signaling mechanisms. Thus, the real contribution of TIRAP to TLR8-mediated cytokine induction might be more prominent, both for purified agonists and whole bacteria, and this issue, thus, warrants further studies.",
