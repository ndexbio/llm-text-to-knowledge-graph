Here, we present evidence that the nuclear exporter exportin-6 and its cargo profilin-1 constitute a functionally important and frequently deregulated axis in cancer. Exportin-6 upregulation occurs in numerous cancer types and is associated with poor patient survival. Reducing exportin-6 level in breast cancer cells triggers antitumor effects by accumulating nuclear profilin-1. Mechanistically, nuclear profilin-1 interacts with eleven-nineteen-leukemia protein (ENL) within the super elongation complex (SEC) and inhibits the ability of the SEC to drive transcription of numerous pro-cancer genes including MYC. XPO6 and MYC are positively correlated across diverse cancer types including breast cancer. Therapeutically, exportin-6 loss sensitizes breast cancer cells to the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitor JQ1. Thus, exportin-6 upregulation is a previously unrecognized cancer driver event by spatially inhibiting nuclear profilin-1 as a tumor suppressor.",

            "text": "In eukaryotic cells, the nuclear membrane compartmentalizes cellular contents into the cytoplasm and nucleus. For large macromolecules such as proteins and RNAs that exceed the diffusion limit of the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), trafficking across the nuclear membrane is mediated by the importin and exportin proteins in the karyopherin beta family. This evolutionarily conserved mechanism ensures the presence of the cargo molecules within their destined subcellular compartments at the levels appropriate for the specific cellular state. However, the physiological balance of many proteins across the nuclear membrane becomes dysregulated in cancer via different mechanisms, including altered expression of nucleocytoplasmic transporters. For instance, tumor-suppressor proteins such as p53, FOXO2, p27, and pRb undergo nuclear exclusion and spatial inactivation in certain cancer cells due to upregulation of their nuclear exporter XPO1/CRM1, which shuttles hundreds of nuclear proteins containing leucine-rich nuclear export sequences (NESs). XPO1 is a marker of poor cancer prognosis, and its inhibition showed anticancer benefits in various preclinical and clinical studies. The XPO1-selective inhibitor Selinexor was recently approved to treat adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).",

Evolutionarily conserved from insects to mammals, XPO6 is essential for Drosophila embryonic development yet transiently silenced in the amphibian Xenopus oocytes prior to meiotic maturation to increase the levels of nuclear filamentous actin that physically stabilize their giant nuclei. In addition, nuclear actin in its monomeric form regulates diverse processes including chromatin remodeling, RNA transcription, and DNA damage response. The consensus from these studies is that nuclear actin positively regulates gene expression and cell proliferation.

As the first actin-binding protein identified decades ago, the role of Pfn1, the ubiquitously expressed Pfn isoform, has been well demonstrated in cytoplasmic actin polymerization and underlies its essentiality for many eukaryotic organisms. Paradoxically, Pfn1 also shows tumor-inhibitory activities in breast, bladder, and pancreatic cancer models. Our prior study suggested that the anticancer activity of Pfn1 stems from its poorly understood nuclear functions that are spatially separate from its essential cytoplasmic functions and requires interaction with at least one nuclear protein containing the poly-L-proline (PLP) motif (XP >= 5; X = G, A, I, S, L). However, our current knowledge of PLP-containing binding partners of nuclear Pfn1 is limited to p42POP and SMN1, neither of which has clear functional relevance to cancer.",

In breast cancer, the average upregulation of XPO6 mRNA is ~1.5-fold. To increase the numbers of normal samples in our analysis, we used the combined RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from TCGA and The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Statistically significant upregulation of XPO6 mRNA levels was confirmed in all 16 cancer types for which processed data are available (Table S1B). Further analysis of matched tumor versus adjacent normal tissues in the TCGA dataset confirmed statistically significant XPO6 mRNA upregulation in 13 cancer types (Table S1C). For breast cancer, 86.6% of the 112 cases with adjacent normal tissues overexpress XPO6 by a median 1.36-fold (Figure 1B). The XPO6 mRNA upregulation occurs independently of breast cancer subtype and stage (Figures S1A-S1C). We next examined the proteomic data of a cohort of 125 breast tumors and 18 normal breast tissue samples in the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) database. Unlike the other nuclear exportins (XPO1, 2, 4, 5, and 7), XPO6 peptides are detected in all tumor samples but none of the normal samples (Figure S1D), indicating their lower protein abundance in normal breast tissues below the detection limit.",

Nuclear accumulation of exogenous yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged Pfn1 was similarly induced by XPO6 loss (Figures S5B-S5D). Pfn1 is a poorly understood tumor suppressor that is paradoxically essential for eukaryotic cells. Restricting Pfn1 expression to the nucleus versus cytoplasm in our prior study indicated that the tumor-suppressive activity of Pfn1 stems at least in part from its nuclear functions, spatially separate from its essential role in the cytoplasm. To test whether the anticancer effect of XPO6 loss is caused by nuclear Pfn1 buildup, we asked whether this effect can be abolished by removing cellular Pfn1. Thus, we performed single or double knockdown of Pfn1 and XPO6 in the MCF-7 cells (Figure 4B). Consistent with the prior report that XPO6 can export nuclear actin independently of Pfn1, nuclear YFP-actin accumulated upon XPO6 knockdown in Pfn1-silenced cells (Figure S5E). However, unlike in the control cells, XPO6 knockdown in the Pfn1-silenced MCF-7 cells caused no growth inhibition (Figures 4B and S5F), suggesting that nuclear Pfn1 buildup underlies the anticancer effect of XPO6 loss.",

We previously showed that the morphological and growth defects of Pfn1 null chondrocytes can be rescued by Pfn1 that is untagged or fused to a NES but not a nuclear localization sequence (NLS). XPO6 knockdown caused no growth inhibition of Pfn1-null chondrocytes infected with an empty vector or YFP (Figures 4C and 4D). Re-expressing untagged or YFP-tagged Pfn1 restored growth inhibition by XPO6 knockdown (Figures 4C, 4D, S5G, and S5H). However, YFP-Pfn1 tagged with an NES, which converts it to a cargo of XPO1 and prevents its nuclear buildup by XPO6 loss, could not restore the shXPO6-induced growth inhibition (Figures 4D and S5H). Together, these data suggest that nuclear Pfn1 accumulation is the underlying cause for cell growth inhibition by XPO6 loss. Notably, the growth inhibition caused by XPO6 knockdown in the mouse chondrocytes differs from its lack of effect in the human mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells. This suggests that non-cancer cells, depending on tissue origin and cellular contexts, may have different sensitivity to nuclear Pfn1 accumulation.",

Out of the 12 TCGA cancer types in which Pfn1 mRNA is significantly altered, seven show upregulation and five show downregulation (Figure S6A; Table S1D). In TCGA breast tumors, Pfn1 mRNA is significantly upregulated (Figures S6A and S6B), and its protein level is markedly higher in the same panel of breast cancer cell lines overexpressing XPO6 (Figure S6C). However, in the CPTAC dataset, Pfn1 protein is significantly downregulated in the breast tumors (Figure S6D). Mixed associations between Pfn1 levels and breast cancer survival were also observed. While high Pfn1 mRNA levels correlate with better survival of stage II (Figure S6E) and lymph-node-negative (Figure S6F; p = 0.12, statistically insignificant) TCGA patients, an opposite trend was observed in the combined GEO and EGA datasets where high Pfn1 mRNA levels correlate with worse survival of lymph-node-negative patients (Figure S6G). Further testing of an individual GEO dataset (GSE21653, showing negative correlation between XPO6 and survival of lymph-node-positive patients in Figure S2F) revealed positive versus negative associations between Pfn1 mRNA levels and the survival of lymph-node-negative and lymph-node-positive patients, respectively (Figure S6H). Nevertheless, no association between Pfn1 protein levels and survival was observed in the same proteomic dataset (Figure S6I) that showed significant association between high XPO6 and worse survival (Figure 1G). These variable results regarding Pfn1 expression and outcome associations, in clear contrast to XPO6, are consistent with the pleiotropic functions of Pfn1 and suggest that its tumor-supportive versus inhibitory activities are balanced in cancer cells stochastically.

We could not validate AFF4 interaction due to the performance issue of the antibody. To confirm the interaction of the SEC with endogenous Pfn1, we performed reciprocal IPs of ENL and cyclin T1. We detected specific co-precipitation of endogenous Pfn1 by ENL antibody and, to a much lesser extent, cyclin T1 antibody (Figure 5D). While similar amounts of Cdk9 were coprecipitated by ENL and cyclin T1, less ENL was pulled down indirectly by cyclin T1 than directly by ENL antibody. This is consistent with the fact that p-TEFb (cyclin T1/Cdk9) associates with different partners besides SEC (e.g., BET domain proteins), and further implicates that the Pfn1/SEC interaction is mediated directly by the PLP motif in ENL. Consistent with this, cyclin T1/Pfn1 interaction was significantly reduced by ENL knockdown (Figure 5E). In addition, we performed size-exclusion chromatography using MDA-MB-231 nuclear extracts. We detected partially overlapping distribution of p-TEFb and ENL, consistent with a prior report. Importantly, endogenous Pfn1 showed a narrow size distribution that overlaps with both ENL and p-TEFb (Figure 5F).

Instead, it increased SEC occupancy at the MYC gene locus, mirroring its effect on MYC mRNA levels and indicating a dominant-negative effect. Since the SEC promotes gene transcription by phosphorylating Ser2 of Rpb1, we performed ChIP for p-Rpb1(Ser2). Reduced p-Rpb1(Ser2) levels were observed at the MYC locus by NLS-Pfn1(WT) expression and XPO6 knockdown (Figures 6H and 6I). The inhibitory effect of nuclear Pfn1 on MYC occupancy of the SEC and p-Rpb1(Ser2) was similarly induced by untagged Pfn1 in a PLP-binding dependent fashion (Figure S7E). Conversely, Pfn1 knockdown increased MYC occupancy of the SEC and p-Rpb1(Ser2) (Figure S7F).

We first performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the differential expression values (fold change of shXPO6 versus shLUC) of all detected genes in XPO6(WT) or XPO6(RNAi-Res) cells. Using the well-annotated hallmark gene sets in the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB), we observed significant enrichment in nine gene sets (Figures 7A, S8A, and S9; Table S4A). Notably, all nine gene sets are negatively enriched by XPO6 knockdown, reflecting gene downregulation, and insignificant in the XPO6(RNAi-Res) cells (Figures 7A, S8A, and S9; Table S4A), confirming that the effects are due to XPO6 loss. Among them, the first and third highest-ranked gene sets by normalized enrichment score are MYC targets V1 and V2. We further confirmed this by examining the transcript levels of NCL, a known MYC-activated gene, and HMOX1, a known MYC-repressed gene, which were inhibited and promoted by XPO6 knockdown, respectively (Figure 7B). In addition to MYC targets, reduced expression of multiple known SEC target genes as a result of XPO6 knockdown in XPO6(WT) but not XPO6(RNAi-Res) cells was detected by RNA-seq and validated by qRT-PCR (Figure 7C). The additional hallmark gene sets in which shXPO6-induced differentially expressed (DE) genes were negatively enriched include E2F targets, epithelial mesenchymal transition, unfolded protein response, MTORC1 signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, reactive oxygen species pathways, and adipogenesis, all of which were rescued by XPO6(RNAi-Res) (Figures S8A and S9; Table S4A).

It was recently reported that SEC inhibition via ENL deletion sensitizes leukemia cells to the BET inhibitor JQ1. Since nuclear Pfn1 inhibits SEC function, we asked whether it could sensitize cancer cells to JQ1. Indeed, XPO6 knockdown (Figure S10A) and KO (Cas9n, Figure S10B; Cas9, Figure 7E) both rendered the triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells, known to depend on Brd4 function, more sensitive to JQ1 in vitro. To confirm this in vivo, we orthotopically injected MDA-MB-231 cells infected with control or two different sgXPO6 viruses in female nude mice. When the average tumor volumes in each group reached ~70 mm3, we randomly divided and treated them daily with vehicle or JQ1 for 3 weeks. Control cells formed tumors significantly faster (by 2 weeks) at a higher frequency (90% versus 50% of injection sites) than the XPO6 KO cells (Figure 7F). Because of the low tumor take rate of XPO6 KO cells, the two sgXPO6 groups were combined for data analysis to increase statistical power. Statistically significant tumor inhibition by JQ1 was observed at multiple time points post-treatment in the sgXPO6 group but not the control group (Figure 7F), and the relative difference in tumor volumes between JQ1 and vehicle-treated mice was significantly larger in the sgXPO6 group than the control group (Figure 7G). Notably, XPO6 protein levels remained low in the resected tumors of the sgXPO6 groups but visibly higher than the levels prior to mouse inoculation (Figures S10C and S10D). This indicates a selection pressure during in vivo expansion to restore XPO6 expression or the amplification of a small fraction of tumor cells with inefficient XPO6 KO. Regardless, our data demonstrate that in addition to being a therapeutic target on its own, XPO6 may be inhibited to enhance the anticancer efficacy of BET inhibitors.",

Despite the largely unexplored role of XPO6 in cancer, we were intrigued by the long-standing paradox regarding the opposing cellular functions of its cargo Pfn1. Although the essentiality of Pfn1 explains the extreme rarity of its loss-of-function mutations in cancer, both its clinical relevance and anticancer mechanism remain poorly defined. Adding to the complexity are the inconsistent patterns of Pfn1 expression changes in cancer. Our earlier report indicated that cell nucleus might be the spatial origin of Pfn1's anticancer function. Work in this paper supports this theory and suggests that Pfn1 is deregulated in cancer primarily on the protein level through nuclear exclusion caused by XPO6 upregulation. This model not only reconciles the paradoxical Pfn1 functions that co-exist in normal cells, but also explains how cancer cells can specifically inhibit the anticancer activity of Pfn1 without compromising its essential cytoplasmic function.",

            "text": "By discovering the interaction between Pfn1 and the SEC, we defined a molecular function of nuclear Pfn1 and linked it directly to cancer. The SEC has been extensively studied for its role in productive transcriptional elongation. Its cancer relevance has long been implicated by the frequent fusion between its different components and the MLL oncogene in childhood leukemia. A recent study showed that MLLT1 (encoding ENL) mutations are causally linked to Wilms tumors. Even in the absence of genetic aberrations, the SEC is important for cancer due to its positive regulation of processive transcription of various pro-cancer genes, most notably MYC. ENL was recently identified as an acetyl-lysine-binding protein, joining the BET family proteins as an epigenetic reader. This supports the idea that the SEC and BET proteins play similar, albeit non-identical, roles in recruiting p-TEFb to acetylated chromatin regions to drive transcription. This is consistent with the finding that ENL depletion in leukemia cells inhibited Cdk9 chromatin recruitment. As for negative regulators of p-TEFb, for nearly two decades the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex remains its only known inhibitor. However, it is unknown whether p-TEFb can be inhibited outside of 7SK snRNP, especially when it is bound with positive regulators. We show that nuclear Pfn1 interacts with the SEC, via direct binding to the PLP motif in ENL, and reduces SEC chromatin occupancy at the MYC locus. This is associated with decreased levels of p-Rpb1(Ser2) (indicative of lower p-TEFb activity) at the MYC gene locus and downregulation of its expression. Interestingly, separate SECs exist containing either ENL or AF9 that occupy the same region in the scaffold protein AFF4. The absence of a PLP motif in AF9 may explain why it was not detected as a binding partner of nuclear Pfn1. Thus, we have identified nuclear Pfn1 as a negative regulator of p-TEFb in the context of ENL-containing SEC.",

            "text": "Consistent with our hypothesis that the pro-cancer effect of XPO6 stems from its ability to reduce nuclear Pfn1 level, XPO6 loss causes a similar inhibition of SEC occupancy at the MYC gene locus and MYC expression. Importantly, both the inhibitory effects of XPO6 loss on MYC expression and cancer cell growth are abolished when Pfn1 is absent, suggesting that it is the nuclear accumulation of Pfn1, rather than actin, that underlies these effects. This is consistent with the positive regulation of general transcription by nuclear actin. In fact, in Pfn1-null mouse chondrocytes, XPO6 loss causes a small, but reproducible, increase in MYC expression and cell growth. Since actin can be exported by XPO6, albeit less efficiently, in the absence of Pfn1, this functionally separates nuclear Pfn1 and actin with regard to their roles in gene regulation. The inhibitory effect of XPO6 loss on the SEC was further confirmed by genome-wide transcriptomic analysis, which showed significant downregulation of multiple MYC target gene sets and known SEC target genes. Since the SEC both promotes MYC expression as a target gene and functionally collaborates with MYC as a transcription factor, the mechanism behind the inhibition of MYC target genes by nuclear Pfn1 could be 2-fold. The significant downregulation of genes involved in proliferation (e.g., E2F targets) and metastasis (e.g., EMT) by XPO6 loss is consistent with the known anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects of Pfn1 in different tumor models and suggests that these effects originate, at least partially, from its nuclear function as an inhibitor of SEC-dependent transcription. It was intriguing to observe the significant downregulation of additional gene sets, as a result of XPO6 loss, that are functionally associated with diverse cellular processes including protein translation, oxidative phosphorylation, and adipogenesis as well as those associated with reactive oxygen species pathways and stem cell signatures, all of which have been positively linked to MYC activation. Consistent with the role of the SEC as a transcriptional activator, nearly all the significantly enriched gene sets and biological pathways represent downregulated genes due to XPO6 loss. The only notable exception was an upregulation of two H3K27me3 gene sets representing repressed target genes of the oncogenic histone methyltransferase EZH2, which coincide with a downregulation of its activated target genes. It was previously shown that MYC stimulates EZH2 expression both transcriptionally as a target gene and post-transcriptionally by repressing its negative regulator miR-26. Thus, the effect of XPO6 loss on EZH2 function may be similarly, and at least partially, caused by MYC repression due to SEC inhibition.",

Consistent with a recent report that ENL depletion sensitizes leukemia cells to JQ1, we observed increased growth inhibition by JQ1 of the triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 with XPO6 loss.

MCF-7 cells stably expressing XPO6(WT) and XPO6 (RNAi-Res) and infected with shLUC or shXPO6#3, were trypsinized, washed with and re-suspended in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), and mixed at a 1:1 ratio with Matrigel (356237, BD Biosciences). 5 x 106 (in 75 mul) cells were injected bilaterally into the 4th mammary glands of each mouse (6 mice/group).

XPO6 cDNAin the lentiviral vector pEZ-Lv151 was purchased from GeneCopoeia (# EX-W2830-Lv151). Silent mutations resistant to shXPO6 #3 (GGAAAGGTTGGTC to AGAGCGCCTCGTG) were introduced by Genewiz between nucleotides 1861-1877 in theXPO6 cDNA (numbering after ATG). Two shRNAs targeting human Pfn1 and a scrambled shCTRL were cloned in the lentiviral pFLRu-FH vector. Silent mutations resistant to shPFN1 #1 and #2 were introduced in human Pfn1 cDNA by QuickChange: AGC to TCG (nucleotide 253-255) and TTG to CTC (nucleotide 367-369). Paired guide RNAs specific for human XPO6 gene used with Cas9 (D10A) nickase (Cas9n) were designed using E-CRISP (http://www.e-crisp.org/E-CRISP/). Oligonucleotides for four pairs of sgRNAs were synthesized, each pair consisting of two annealed oligonucleotides whose target sequences in XPO6 are <= 20 base pairs apart. Following oligo annealing, they were inserted into the BbsI sites of the pSpCas9n(BB)-2A-Puro vector (PX462, Addgene 48141). Single guide RNAs for human XPO6 used with wild-type Cas9 were similarly designed, and cloned into the BsmBI site in the lentiCRISPRv2.0 vector (Addgene #52961).",

For overall and progression-free survival analysis of TCGA breast cancer patients divided based on lymph node and ER status (Figures S2B-S2D and S6F), RNA-seq data were downloaded from FireBrowse and curated clinical data were downloaded from the UCSC Xena Browser, and then imported into KM plotter for statistical analysis and graph generation using the web-based custom plotting function. For relapse-free survival of breast cancer patients in the GEO and EGA datasets (Figures S2E-S2H, S6G, and S6H), gene chip data and clinical information hosted at KM plotter were used. For overall survival analysis against proteomic data (Figures 1G and S6I), a published study consisting of mass spectrometry data and clinical information of 65 breast cancer patients available at KM plotter was used. For all analyses, median cutoff was chosen to split cohorts evenly into subgroups with high versus low mRNA or protein levels of XPO6 and Pfn1. For analyses using gene chip data, JetSet best probe sets for XPO6 and Pfn1 (Affimetrix ID 211982 and 200634) were selected. Log-rank tests were used to calculate p values.",
