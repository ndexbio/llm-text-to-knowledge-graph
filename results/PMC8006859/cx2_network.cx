For large macromolecules such as proteins and RNAs that exceed the diffusion limit of the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), trafficking across the nuclear membrane is mediated by the importin and exportin proteins in the karyopherin beta family. This evolutionarily conserved mechanism ensures the presence of the cargo molecules within their destined subcellular compartments at the levels appropriate for the specific cellular state. However, the physiological balance of many proteins across the nuclear membrane becomes dysregulated in cancer via different mechanisms, including altered expression of nucleocytoplasmic transporters. For instance, tumor-suppressor proteins such as p53, FOXO2, p27, and pRb undergo nuclear exclusion and spatial inactivation in certain cancer cells due to upregulation of their nuclear exporter XPO1/CRM1, which shuttles hundreds of nuclear proteins containing leucine-rich nuclear export sequences (NESs). XPO1 is a marker of poor cancer prognosis, and its inhibition showed anticancer benefits in various preclinical and clinical studies. The XPO1-selective inhibitor Selinexor was recently approved to treat adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).",

XPO6 mRNA is significantly upregulated in 19 cancer types compared to normal controls (~1.2-1.9-fold), with thyroid carcinoma being the only cancer type showing downregulation (Figure 1A; Table S1A). In breast cancer, the average upregulation of XPO6 mRNA is ~1.5-fold. To increase the numbers of normal samples in our analysis, we used the combined RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from TCGA and The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Statistically significant upregulation of XPO6 mRNA levels was confirmed in all 16 cancer types for which processed data are available (Table S1B). Further analysis of matched tumor versus adjacent normal tissues in the TCGA dataset confirmed statistically significant XPO6 mRNA upregulation in 13 cancer types (Table S1C). For breast cancer, 86.6% of the 112 cases with adjacent normal tissues overexpress XPO6 by a median 1.36-fold (Figure 1B). The XPO6 mRNA upregulation occurs independently of breast cancer subtype and stage (Figures S1A-S1C).

Out of the 12 TCGA cancer types in which Pfn1 mRNA is significantly altered, seven show upregulation and five show downregulation (Figure S6A; Table S1D). In TCGA breast tumors, Pfn1 mRNA is significantly upregulated (Figures S6A and S6B), and its protein level is markedly higher in the same panel of breast cancer cell lines overexpressing XPO6 (Figure S6C). However, in the CPTAC dataset, Pfn1 protein is significantly downregulated in the breast tumors (Figure S6D). Mixed associations between Pfn1 levels and breast cancer survival were also observed. While high Pfn1 mRNA levels correlate with better survival of stage II (Figure S6E) and lymph-node-negative (Figure S6F; p = 0.12, statistically insignificant) TCGA patients, an opposite trend was observed in the combined GEO and EGA datasets where high Pfn1 mRNA levels correlate with worse survival of lymph-node-negative patients (Figure S6G). Further testing of an individual GEO dataset (GSE21653, showing negative correlation between XPO6 and survival of lymph-node-positive patients in Figure S2F) revealed positive versus negative associations between Pfn1 mRNA levels and the survival of lymph-node-negative and lymph-node-positive patients, respectively (Figure S6H). Nevertheless, no association between Pfn1 protein levels and survival was observed in the same proteomic dataset (Figure S6I) that showed significant association between high XPO6 and worse survival (Figure 1G). These variable results regarding Pfn1 expression and outcome associations, in clear contrast to XPO6, are consistent with the pleiotropic functions of Pfn1 and suggest that its tumor-supportive versus inhibitory activities are balanced in cancer cells stochastically. Therefore, total Pfn1 levels do not accurately reflect its anticancer activities.",

Thus, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) of NLS-tagged YFP-Pfn1 from MDA-MB-231 nuclear extracts followed by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis to identify associated proteins. We used YFP as a non-specific binding control and a mutant NLS-Pfn1(S137D) unable to bind PLPs to exclude PLP-independent interactions (Figure 5A). Based on a 1% peptide false discovery rate and a relative protein expression ratio of >1.5 in the NLS-Pfn1(WT) versus YFP and NLS-Pfn1 S137D, we identified 37 proteins interacting with NLS-Pfn1(WT) in a PLP-dependent fashion (Table S2).",

SFPQ is a multi-functional protein involved in pre-mRNA splicing and context-dependent transcriptional regulation. ENL is an acetyl-lysine-binding transcriptional activator functioning primarily within the multi-component SEC. The SEC is a positive regulator of transcriptional elongation by phosphorylating Ser2 of the Rpb1 subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) via the associated p-TEFb dimeric complex comprising Cdk9 and cyclin T1 or T2. This releases RNA Pol II from the \"paused\" state at the promoter proximal regions of many active genes and leads to their productive elongation. Notably, in addition to ENL, we detected three SEC components by MS including AFF4, ELL, and cyclin T1, all of which preferentially bound NLS-Pfn1(WT) over NLS-Pfn1(S137D) and YFP (Figure 5B).",

In addition to ENL and Cyclin T1, we detected interactions of Cdk9 and Rbp1 with NLS-Pfn1(WT) but not NLS-Pfn1(S137D) or YFP (Figure 5C). We could not validate AFF4 interaction due to the performance issue of the antibody. To confirm the interaction of the SEC with endogenous Pfn1, we performed reciprocal IPs of ENL and cyclin T1. We detected specific co-precipitation of endogenous Pfn1 by ENL antibody and, to a much lesser extent, cyclin T1 antibody (Figure 5D). While similar amounts of Cdk9 were coprecipitated by ENL and cyclin T1, less ENL was pulled down indirectly by cyclin T1 than directly by ENL antibody. This is consistent with the fact that p-TEFb (cyclin T1/Cdk9) associates with different partners besides SEC (e.g., BET domain proteins), and further implicates that the Pfn1/SEC interaction is mediated directly by the PLP motif in ENL. Consistent with this, cyclin T1/Pfn1 interaction was significantly reduced by ENL knockdown (Figure 5E). In addition, we performed size-exclusion chromatography using MDA-MB-231 nuclear extracts. We detected partially overlapping distribution of p-TEFb and ENL, consistent with a prior report. Importantly, endogenous Pfn1 showed a narrow size distribution that overlaps with both ENL and p-TEFb (Figure 5F). Collectively, our data revealed a previously unknown interaction between nuclear Pfn1 and the SEC via the direct binding of Pfn1 to the PLP motif within ENL.",

Using antibodies for ENL, Cdk9, and cyclin T1 and MYC-specific primers, we detected significant inhibition of chromatin occupancy of the SEC by both NLS-Pfn1(WT) and XPO6 knockdown (Figures 6H and 6I). Consistent with the importance of PLP binding in Pfn1/SEC interaction, NLS-Pfn1(S137D) failed to inhibit SEC chromatin occupancy. Instead, it increased SEC occupancy at the MYC gene locus, mirroring its effect on MYC mRNA levels and indicating a dominant-negative effect. Since the SEC promotes gene transcription by phosphorylating Ser2 of Rpb1, we performed ChIP for p-Rpb1(Ser2). Reduced p-Rpb1(Ser2) levels were observed at the MYC locus by NLS-Pfn1(WT) expression and XPO6 knockdown (Figures 6H and 6I). The inhibitory effect of nuclear Pfn1 on MYC occupancy of the SEC and p-Rpb1(Ser2) was similarly induced by untagged Pfn1 in a PLP-binding dependent fashion (Figure S7E). Conversely, Pfn1 knockdown increased MYC occupancy of the SEC and p-Rpb1(Ser2) (Figure S7F). Further, H3K36me3, a positive transcriptional marker depending on transcriptional elongation by p-Rpb1(Ser2), was significantly decreased at the MYC locus by NLS-Pfn1(WT) and XPO6 knockdown (Figures 6H and 6I).

Since nuclear Pfn1 inhibits SEC function, we asked whether it could sensitize cancer cells to JQ1. Indeed, XPO6 knockdown (Figure S10A) and KO (Cas9n, Figure S10B; Cas9, Figure 7E) both rendered the triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells, known to depend on Brd4 function, more sensitive to JQ1 in vitro.

Control cells formed tumors significantly faster (by 2 weeks) at a higher frequency (90% versus 50% of injection sites) than the XPO6 KO cells (Figure 7F). Because of the low tumor take rate of XPO6 KO cells, the two sgXPO6 groups were combined for data analysis to increase statistical power. Statistically significant tumor inhibition by JQ1 was observed at multiple time points post-treatment in the sgXPO6 group but not the control group (Figure 7F), and the relative difference in tumor volumes between JQ1 and vehicle-treated mice was significantly larger in the sgXPO6 group than the control group (Figure 7G).

Here, we focused on the highly selective nuclear exporter XPO6, whose only known cargo is the dimeric actin/Pfn complex. Despite the largely unexplored role of XPO6 in cancer, we were intrigued by the long-standing paradox regarding the opposing cellular functions of its cargo Pfn1. Although the essentiality of Pfn1 explains the extreme rarity of its loss-of-function mutations in cancer, both its clinical relevance and anticancer mechanism remain poorly defined. Adding to the complexity are the inconsistent patterns of Pfn1 expression changes in cancer. Our earlier report indicated that cell nucleus might be the spatial origin of Pfn1's anticancer function. Work in this paper supports this theory and suggests that Pfn1 is deregulated in cancer primarily on the protein level through nuclear exclusion caused by XPO6 upregulation. This model not only reconciles the paradoxical Pfn1 functions that co-exist in normal cells, but also explains how cancer cells can specifically inhibit the anticancer activity of Pfn1 without compromising its essential cytoplasmic function.",

Importantly, both the inhibitory effects of XPO6 loss on MYC expression and cancer cell growth are abolished when Pfn1 is absent, suggesting that it is the nuclear accumulation of Pfn1, rather than actin, that underlies these effects. This is consistent with the positive regulation of general transcription by nuclear actin. In fact, in Pfn1-null mouse chondrocytes, XPO6 loss causes a small, but reproducible, increase in MYC expression and cell growth. Since actin can be exported by XPO6, albeit less efficiently, in the absence of Pfn1, this functionally separates nuclear Pfn1 and actin with regard to their roles in gene regulation. The inhibitory effect of XPO6 loss on the SEC was further confirmed by genome-wide transcriptomic analysis, which showed significant downregulation of multiple MYC target gene sets and known SEC target genes. Since the SEC both promotes MYC expression as a target gene and functionally collaborates with MYC as a transcription factor, the mechanism behind the inhibition of MYC target genes by nuclear Pfn1 could be 2-fold. The significant downregulation of genes involved in proliferation (e.g., E2F targets) and metastasis (e.g., EMT) by XPO6 loss is consistent with the known anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects of Pfn1 in different tumor models and suggests that these effects originate, at least partially, from its nuclear function as an inhibitor of SEC-dependent transcription. It was intriguing to observe the significant downregulation of additional gene sets, as a result of XPO6 loss, that are functionally associated with diverse cellular processes including protein translation, oxidative phosphorylation, and adipogenesis as well as those associated with reactive oxygen species pathways and stem cell signatures, all of which have been positively linked to MYC activation. Consistent with the role of the SEC as a transcriptional activator, nearly all the significantly enriched gene sets and biological pathways represent downregulated genes due to XPO6 loss. The only notable exception was an upregulation of two H3K27me3 gene sets representing repressed target genes of the oncogenic histone methyltransferase EZH2, which coincide with a downregulation of its activated target genes. It was previously shown that MYC stimulates EZH2 expression both transcriptionally as a target gene and post-transcriptionally by repressing its negative regulator miR-26. Thus, the effect of XPO6 loss on EZH2 function may be similarly, and at least partially, caused by MYC repression due to SEC inhibition.",

Importantly, both the inhibitory effects of XPO6 loss on MYC expression and cancer cell growth are abolished when Pfn1 is absent, suggesting that it is the nuclear accumulation of Pfn1, rather than actin, that underlies these effects. This is consistent with the positive regulation of general transcription by nuclear actin. In fact, in Pfn1-null mouse chondrocytes, XPO6 loss causes a small, but reproducible, increase in MYC expression and cell growth. Since actin can be exported by XPO6, albeit less efficiently, in the absence of Pfn1, this functionally separates nuclear Pfn1 and actin with regard to their roles in gene regulation. The inhibitory effect of XPO6 loss on the SEC was further confirmed by genome-wide transcriptomic analysis, which showed significant downregulation of multiple MYC target gene sets and known SEC target genes. Since the SEC both promotes MYC expression as a target gene and functionally collaborates with MYC as a transcription factor, the mechanism behind the inhibition of MYC target genes by nuclear Pfn1 could be 2-fold. The significant downregulation of genes involved in proliferation (e.g., E2F targets) and metastasis (e.g., EMT) by XPO6 loss is consistent with the known anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects of Pfn1 in different tumor models and suggests that these effects originate, at least partially, from its nuclear function as an inhibitor of SEC-dependent transcription. It was intriguing to observe the significant downregulation of additional gene sets, as a result of XPO6 loss, that are functionally associated with diverse cellular processes including protein translation, oxidative phosphorylation, and adipogenesis as well as those associated with reactive oxygen species pathways and stem cell signatures, all of which have been positively linked to MYC activation. Consistent with the role of the SEC as a transcriptional activator, nearly all the significantly enriched gene sets and biological pathways represent downregulated genes due to XPO6 loss. The only notable exception was an upregulation of two H3K27me3 gene sets representing repressed target genes of the oncogenic histone methyltransferase EZH2, which coincide with a downregulation of its activated target genes. It was previously shown that MYC stimulates EZH2 expression both transcriptionally as a target gene and post-transcriptionally by repressing its negative regulator miR-26. Thus, the effect of XPO6 loss on EZH2 function may be similarly, and at least partially, caused by MYC repression due to SEC inhibition.",

MCF-7 cells stably expressing XPO6(WT) and XPO6 (RNAi-Res) and infected with shLUC or shXPO6#3, were trypsinized, washed with and re-suspended in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), and mixed at a 1:1 ratio with Matrigel (356237, BD Biosciences). 5 x 106 (in 75 mul) cells were injected bilaterally into the 4th mammary glands of each mouse (6 mice/group). For ER-MDA-MB-231 cells stably infected with lentiCRISPRv2.0 lacking (control) or containing sgXPO6 #1 or #3, 1.7 x 106 in 75 mul were injected bilaterally into the 4th mammary fad pads of female nude mice without estrogen pellets (10 mice per group). Tumor volumes were measured bi-weekly by Caliper. Tumor volumes were calculated using the formula: tumor volume [mm3] = 1/2 x (tumor length) x (tumor width)2 . For MCF-7 cells, the experiment was terminated at 11 weeks post injection when the largest tumors reached around 1.5cm in diameter. For MDA-MB-231 cells, mice in each group were randomly divided into vehicle and JQ1 treatment groups (3-5 mice per group depending on the numbers of tumor-bearing mice) when the average tumor volume reached approximately 70mm3. JQ1 (S7110, Selleckchem) was freshly prepared each day by diluting 10x stock solution (0.5 mg/6 mul, 83.3mg/ml, in DMSO) into 1x working solution (0.05 mg/6 mul) using vehicle (10% hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin in 0.9% sodium chloride). Mice received intraperitoneal injection of equal volume of vehicle or JQ1 at a daily dose of 50mg/kg for three weeks, during which tumors were measured semiweekly. Mice were euthanized and tumors were resected, weighed, and saved for further analyses.",

For overall survival analysis of various TCGA datasets as undivided cohorts (Figures 1E and S6E) or stage-defined sub-cohorts (Figures 1F, 2A, and S6E), RNA-seq data and clinical information hosted by KM plotter were used. For overall and progression-free survival analysis of TCGA breast cancer patients divided based on lymph node and ER status (Figures S2B-S2D and S6F), RNA-seq data were downloaded from FireBrowse and curated clinical data were downloaded from the UCSC Xena Browser, and then imported into KM plotter for statistical analysis and graph generation using the web-based custom plotting function. For relapse-free survival of breast cancer patients in the GEO and EGA datasets (Figures S2E-S2H, S6G, and S6H), gene chip data and clinical information hosted at KM plotter were used. For overall survival analysis against proteomic data (Figures 1G and S6I), a published study consisting of mass spectrometry data and clinical information of 65 breast cancer patients available at KM plotter was used. For all analyses, median cutoff was chosen to split cohorts evenly into subgroups with high versus low mRNA or protein levels of XPO6 and Pfn1. For analyses using gene chip data, JetSet best probe sets for XPO6 and Pfn1 (Affimetrix ID 211982 and 200634) were selected. Log-rank tests were used to calculate p values.",
