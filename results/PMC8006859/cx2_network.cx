XPO6 mRNA is significantly upregulated in 19 cancer types compared to normal controls (~1.2-1.9-fold), with thyroid carcinoma being the only cancer type showing downregulation (Figure 1A; Table S1A). In breast cancer, the average upregulation of XPO6 mRNA is ~1.5-fold. To increase the numbers of normal samples in our analysis, we used the combined RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from TCGA and The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Statistically significant upregulation of XPO6 mRNA levels was confirmed in all 16 cancer types for which processed data are available (Table S1B). Further analysis of matched tumor versus adjacent normal tissues in the TCGA dataset confirmed statistically significant XPO6 mRNA upregulation in 13 cancer types (Table S1C). For breast cancer, 86.6% of the 112 cases with adjacent normal tissues overexpress XPO6 by a median 1.36-fold (Figure 1B). The XPO6 mRNA upregulation occurs independently of breast cancer subtype and stage (Figures S1A-S1C). We next examined the proteomic data of a cohort of 125 breast tumors and 18 normal breast tissue samples in the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) database. Unlike the other nuclear exportins (XPO1, 2, 4, 5, and 7), XPO6 peptides are detected in all tumor samples but none of the normal samples (Figure S1D), indicating their lower protein abundance in normal breast tissues below the detection limit."

We first performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the differential expression values (fold change of shXPO6 versus shLUC) of all detected genes in XPO6(WT) or XPO6(RNAi-Res) cells. Using the well-annotated hallmark gene sets in the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB), we observed significant enrichment in nine gene sets (Figures 7A, S8A, and S9; Table S4A). Notably, all nine gene sets are negatively enriched by XPO6 knockdown, reflecting gene downregulation, and insignificant in the XPO6(RNAi-Res) cells (Figures 7A, S8A, and S9; Table S4A), confirming that the effects are due to XPO6 loss. Among them, the first and third highest-ranked gene sets by normalized enrichment score are MYC targets V1 and V2. We further confirmed this by examining the transcript levels of NCL, a known MYC-activated gene, and HMOX1, a known MYC-repressed gene, which were inhibited and promoted by XPO6 knockdown, respectively (Figure 7B). In addition to MYC targets, reduced expression of multiple known SEC target genes as a result of XPO6 knockdown in XPO6(WT) but not XPO6(RNAi-Res) cells was detected by RNA-seq and validated by qRT-PCR (Figure 7C). The additional hallmark gene sets in which shXPO6-induced differentially expressed (DE) genes were negatively enriched include E2F targets, epithelial mesenchymal transition, unfolded protein response, MTORC1 signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, reactive oxygen species pathways, and adipogenesis, all of which were rescued by XPO6(RNAi-Res) (Figures S8A and S9; Table S4A). This indicates that XPO6 loss inhibits a multitude of cancer-driving processes related to proliferation, metastasis, and metabolism."

It was recently reported that SEC inhibition via ENL deletion sensitizes leukemia cells to the BET inhibitor JQ1. Since nuclear Pfn1 inhibits SEC function, we asked whether it could sensitize cancer cells to JQ1. Indeed, XPO6 knockdown (Figure S10A) and KO (Cas9n, Figure S10B; Cas9, Figure 7E) both rendered the triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells, known to depend on Brd4 function, more sensitive to JQ1 in vitro. To confirm this in vivo, we orthotopically injected MDA-MB-231 cells infected with control or two different sgXPO6 viruses in female nude mice. When the average tumor volumes in each group reached ~70 mm3, we randomly divided and treated them daily with vehicle or JQ1 for 3 weeks. Control cells formed tumors significantly faster (by 2 weeks) at a higher frequency (90% versus 50% of injection sites) than the XPO6 KO cells (Figure 7F). Because of the low tumor take rate of XPO6 KO cells, the two sgXPO6 groups were combined for data analysis to increase statistical power. Statistically significant tumor inhibition by JQ1 was observed at multiple time points post-treatment in the sgXPO6 group but not the control group (Figure 7F), and the relative difference in tumor volumes between JQ1 and vehicle-treated mice was significantly larger in the sgXPO6 group than the control group (Figure 7G). Notably, XPO6 protein levels remained low in the resected tumors of the sgXPO6 groups but visibly higher than the levels prior to mouse inoculation (Figures S10C and S10D). This indicates a selection pressure during in vivo expansion to restore XPO6 expression or the amplification of a small fraction of tumor cells with inefficient XPO6 KO. Regardless, our data demonstrate that in addition to being a therapeutic target on its own, XPO6 may be inhibited to enhance the anticancer efficacy of BET inhibitors."

Despite the largely unexplored role of XPO6 in cancer, we were intrigued by the long-standing paradox regarding the opposing cellular functions of its cargo Pfn1. Although the essentiality of Pfn1 explains the extreme rarity of its loss-of-function mutations in cancer, both its clinical relevance and anticancer mechanism remain poorly defined. Adding to the complexity are the inconsistent patterns of Pfn1 expression changes in cancer. Our earlier report indicated that cell nucleus might be the spatial origin of Pfn1's anticancer function. Work in this paper supports this theory and suggests that Pfn1 is deregulated in cancer primarily on the protein level through nuclear exclusion caused by XPO6 upregulation. This model not only reconciles the paradoxical Pfn1 functions that co-exist in normal cells, but also explains how cancer cells can specifically inhibit the anticancer activity of Pfn1 without compromising its essential cytoplasmic function."

The SEC has been extensively studied for its role in productive transcriptional elongation. Its cancer relevance has long been implicated by the frequent fusion between its different components and the MLL oncogene in childhood leukemia. A recent study showed that MLLT1 (encoding ENL) mutations are causally linked to Wilms tumors. Even in the absence of genetic aberrations, the SEC is important for cancer due to its positive regulation of processive transcription of various pro-cancer genes, most notably MYC. ENL was recently identified as an acetyl-lysine-binding protein, joining the BET family proteins as an epigenetic reader. This supports the idea that the SEC and BET proteins play similar, albeit non-identical, roles in recruiting p-TEFb to acetylated chromatin regions to drive transcription. This is consistent with the finding that ENL depletion in leukemia cells inhibited Cdk9 chromatin recruitment. As for negative regulators of p-TEFb, for nearly two decades the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex remains its only known inhibitor. However, it is unknown whether p-TEFb can be inhibited outside of 7SK snRNP, especially when it is bound with positive regulators. We show that nuclear Pfn1 interacts with the SEC, via direct binding to the PLP motif in ENL, and reduces SEC chromatin occupancy at the MYC locus. This is associated with decreased levels of p-Rpb1(Ser2) (indicative of lower p-TEFb activity) at the MYC gene locus and downregulation of its expression. Interestingly, separate SECs exist containing either ENL or AF9 that occupy the same region in the scaffold protein AFF4. The absence of a PLP motif in AF9 may explain why it was not detected as a binding partner of nuclear Pfn1. Thus, we have identified nuclear Pfn1 as a negative regulator of p-TEFb in the context of ENL-containing SEC."

                    "text": "Consistent with our hypothesis that the pro-cancer effect of XPO6 stems from its ability to reduce nuclear Pfn1 level, XPO6 loss causes a similar inhibition of SEC occupancy at the MYC gene locus and MYC expression. Importantly, both the inhibitory effects of XPO6 loss on MYC expression and cancer cell growth are abolished when Pfn1 is absent, suggesting that it is the nuclear accumulation of Pfn1, rather than actin, that underlies these effects. This is consistent with the positive regulation of general transcription by nuclear actin. In fact, in Pfn1-null mouse chondrocytes, XPO6 loss causes a small, but reproducible, increase in MYC expression and cell growth. Since actin can be exported by XPO6, albeit less efficiently, in the absence of Pfn1, this functionally separates nuclear Pfn1 and actin with regard to their roles in gene regulation. The inhibitory effect of XPO6 loss on the SEC was further confirmed by genome-wide transcriptomic analysis, which showed significant downregulation of multiple MYC target gene sets and known SEC target genes. Since the SEC both promotes MYC expression as a target gene and functionally collaborates with MYC as a transcription factor, the mechanism behind the inhibition of MYC target genes by nuclear Pfn1 could be 2-fold. The significant downregulation of genes involved in proliferation (e.g., E2F targets) and metastasis (e.g., EMT) by XPO6 loss is consistent with the known anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects of Pfn1 in different tumor models and suggests that these effects originate, at least partially, from its nuclear function as an inhibitor of SEC-dependent transcription. It was intriguing to observe the significant downregulation of additional gene sets, as a result of XPO6 loss, that are functionally associated with diverse cellular processes including protein translation, oxidative phosphorylation, and adipogenesis as well as those associated with reactive oxygen species pathways and stem cell signatures, all of which have been positively linked to MYC activation. Consistent with the role of the SEC as a transcriptional activator, nearly all the significantly enriched gene sets and biological pathways represent downregulated genes due to XPO6 loss. The only notable exception was an upregulation of two H3K27me3 gene sets representing repressed target genes of the oncogenic histone methyltransferase EZH2, which coincide with a downregulation of its activated target genes. It was previously shown that MYC stimulates EZH2 expression both transcriptionally as a target gene and post-transcriptionally by repressing its negative regulator miR-26. Thus, the effect of XPO6 loss on EZH2 function may be similarly, and at least partially, caused by MYC repression due to SEC inhibition."

                    "text": "Consistent with our hypothesis that the pro-cancer effect of XPO6 stems from its ability to reduce nuclear Pfn1 level, XPO6 loss causes a similar inhibition of SEC occupancy at the MYC gene locus and MYC expression. Importantly, both the inhibitory effects of XPO6 loss on MYC expression and cancer cell growth are abolished when Pfn1 is absent, suggesting that it is the nuclear accumulation of Pfn1, rather than actin, that underlies these effects. This is consistent with the positive regulation of general transcription by nuclear actin. In fact, in Pfn1-null mouse chondrocytes, XPO6 loss causes a small, but reproducible, increase in MYC expression and cell growth. Since actin can be exported by XPO6, albeit less efficiently, in the absence of Pfn1, this functionally separates nuclear Pfn1 and actin with regard to their roles in gene regulation. The inhibitory effect of XPO6 loss on the SEC was further confirmed by genome-wide transcriptomic analysis, which showed significant downregulation of multiple MYC target gene sets and known SEC target genes. Since the SEC both promotes MYC expression as a target gene and functionally collaborates with MYC as a transcription factor, the mechanism behind the inhibition of MYC target genes by nuclear Pfn1 could be 2-fold. The significant downregulation of genes involved in proliferation (e.g., E2F targets) and metastasis (e.g., EMT) by XPO6 loss is consistent with the known anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects of Pfn1 in different tumor models and suggests that these effects originate, at least partially, from its nuclear function as an inhibitor of SEC-dependent transcription. It was intriguing to observe the significant downregulation of additional gene sets, as a result of XPO6 loss, that are functionally associated with diverse cellular processes including protein translation, oxidative phosphorylation, and adipogenesis as well as those associated with reactive oxygen species pathways and stem cell signatures, all of which have been positively linked to MYC activation. Consistent with the role of the SEC as a transcriptional activator, nearly all the significantly enriched gene sets and biological pathways represent downregulated genes due to XPO6 loss. The only notable exception was an upregulation of two H3K27me3 gene sets representing repressed target genes of the oncogenic histone methyltransferase EZH2, which coincide with a downregulation of its activated target genes.

For ER-positive MCF-7 cells, estrogen pellets (17beta estradiol, 0.75 mg/pellet, 90 days release; Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL) were implanted subcutaneously a day before tumor cell implantation. MCF-7 cells stably expressing XPO6(WT) and XPO6 (RNAi-Res) and infected with shLUC or shXPO6#3, were trypsinized, washed with and re-suspended in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), and mixed at a 1:1 ratio with Matrigel (356237, BD Biosciences). 5 x 106 (in 75 mul) cells were injected bilaterally into the 4th mammary glands of each mouse (6 mice/group). For ER-MDA-MB-231 cells stably infected with lentiCRISPRv2.0 lacking (control) or containing sgXPO6 #1 or #3, 1.7 x 106 in 75 mul were injected bilaterally into the 4th mammary fad pads of female nude mice without estrogen pellets (10 mice per group). Tumor volumes were measured bi-weekly by Caliper. Tumor volumes were calculated using the formula: tumor volume [mm3] = 1/2 x (tumor length) x (tumor width)2 . For MCF-7 cells, the experiment was terminated at 11 weeks post injection when the largest tumors reached around 1.5cm in diameter. For MDA-MB-231 cells, mice in each group were randomly divided into vehicle and JQ1 treatment groups (3-5 mice per group depending on the numbers of tumor-bearing mice) when the average tumor volume reached approximately 70mm3. JQ1 (S7110, Selleckchem) was freshly prepared each day by diluting 10x stock solution (0.5 mg/6 mul, 83.3mg/ml, in DMSO) into 1x working solution (0.05 mg/6 mul) using vehicle (10% hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin in 0.9% sodium chloride). Mice received intraperitoneal injection of equal volume of vehicle or JQ1 at a daily dose of 50mg/kg for three weeks, during which tumors were measured semiweekly. Mice were euthanized and tumors were resected, weighed, and saved for further analyses."

Silent mutations resistant to shXPO6 #3 (GGAAAGGTTGGTC to AGAGCGCCTCGTG) were introduced by Genewiz between nucleotides 1861-1877 in theXPO6 cDNA (numbering after ATG). Two shRNAs targeting human Pfn1 and a scrambled shCTRL were cloned in the lentiviral pFLRu-FH vector. Silent mutations resistant to shPFN1 #1 and #2 were introduced in human Pfn1 cDNA by QuickChange: AGC to TCG (nucleotide 253-255) and TTG to CTC (nucleotide 367-369). Paired guide RNAs specific for human XPO6 gene used with Cas9 (D10A) nickase (Cas9n) were designed using E-CRISP (http://www.e-crisp.org/E-CRISP/). Oligonucleotides for four pairs of sgRNAs were synthesized, each pair consisting of two annealed oligonucleotides whose target sequences in XPO6 are <= 20 base pairs apart. Following oligo annealing, they were inserted into the BbsI sites of the pSpCas9n(BB)-2A-Puro vector (PX462, Addgene 48141). Single guide RNAs for human XPO6 used with wild-type Cas9 were similarly designed, and cloned into the BsmBI site in the lentiCRISPRv2.0 vector (Addgene #52961)."

Thus, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) of NLS-tagged YFP-Pfn1 from MDA-MB-231 nuclear extracts followed by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis to identify associated proteins. We used YFP as a non-specific binding control and a mutant NLS-Pfn1(S137D) unable to bind PLPs to exclude PLP-independent interactions (Figure 5A). Based on a 1% peptide false discovery rate and a relative protein expression ratio of >1.5 in the NLS-Pfn1(WT) versus YFP and NLS-Pfn1 S137D, we identified 37 proteins interacting with NLS-Pfn1(WT) in a PLP-dependent fashion (Table S2).",

This releases RNA Pol II from the \"paused\" state at the promoter proximal regions of many active genes and leads to their productive elongation. Notably, in addition to ENL, we detected three SEC components by MS including AFF4, ELL, and cyclin T1, all of which preferentially bound NLS-Pfn1(WT) over NLS-Pfn1(S137D) and YFP (Figure 5B).",

Using antibodies for ENL, Cdk9, and cyclin T1 and MYC-specific primers, we detected significant inhibition of chromatin occupancy of the SEC by both NLS-Pfn1(WT) and XPO6 knockdown (Figures 6H and 6I). Consistent with the importance of PLP binding in Pfn1/SEC interaction, NLS-Pfn1(S137D) failed to inhibit SEC chromatin occupancy. Instead, it increased SEC occupancy at the MYC gene locus, mirroring its effect on MYC mRNA levels and indicating a dominant-negative effect. Since the SEC promotes gene transcription by phosphorylating Ser2 of Rpb1, we performed ChIP for p-Rpb1(Ser2). Reduced p-Rpb1(Ser2) levels were observed at the MYC locus by NLS-Pfn1(WT) expression and XPO6 knockdown (Figures 6H and 6I). The inhibitory effect of nuclear Pfn1 on MYC occupancy of the SEC and p-Rpb1(Ser2) was similarly induced by untagged Pfn1 in a PLP-binding dependent fashion (Figure S7E). Conversely, Pfn1 knockdown increased MYC occupancy of the SEC and p-Rpb1(Ser2) (Figure S7F). Further, H3K36me3, a positive transcriptional marker depending on transcriptional elongation by p-Rpb1(Ser2), was significantly decreased at the MYC locus by NLS-Pfn1(WT) and XPO6 knockdown (Figures 6H and 6I). These data suggest that nuclear Pfn1, increased by XPO6 loss, inhibits the transcription of MYC by blocking chromatin recruitment of SEC and the consequent Ser2 phosphorylation of RNA Pol II necessary for transcription elongation.",

Here, we focused on the highly selective nuclear exporter XPO6, whose only known cargo is the dimeric actin/Pfn complex. Despite the largely unexplored role of XPO6 in cancer, we were intrigued by the long-standing paradox regarding the opposing cellular functions of its cargo Pfn1. Although the essentiality of Pfn1 explains the extreme rarity of its loss-of-function mutations in cancer, both its clinical relevance and anticancer mechanism remain poorly defined. Adding to the complexity are the inconsistent patterns of Pfn1 expression changes in cancer. Our earlier report indicated that cell nucleus might be the spatial origin of Pfn1's anticancer function. Work in this paper supports this theory and suggests that Pfn1 is deregulated in cancer primarily on the protein level through nuclear exclusion caused by XPO6 upregulation.

A recent study showed that MLLT1 (encoding ENL) mutations are causally linked to Wilms tumors. Even in the absence of genetic aberrations, the SEC is important for cancer due to its positive regulation of processive transcription of various pro-cancer genes, most notably MYC.

As for negative regulators of p-TEFb, for nearly two decades the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex remains its only known inhibitor. However, it is unknown whether p-TEFb can be inhibited outside of 7SK snRNP, especially when it is bound with positive regulators. We show that nuclear Pfn1 interacts with the SEC, via direct binding to the PLP motif in ENL, and reduces SEC chromatin occupancy at the MYC locus.

This is consistent with the positive regulation of general transcription by nuclear actin. In fact, in Pfn1-null mouse chondrocytes, XPO6 loss causes a small, but reproducible, increase in MYC expression and cell growth.

Since actin can be exported by XPO6, albeit less efficiently, in the absence of Pfn1, this functionally separates nuclear Pfn1 and actin with regard to their roles in gene regulation. The inhibitory effect of XPO6 loss on the SEC was further confirmed by genome-wide transcriptomic analysis, which showed significant downregulation of multiple MYC target gene sets and known SEC target genes. Since the SEC both promotes MYC expression as a target gene and functionally collaborates with MYC as a transcription factor, the mechanism behind the inhibition of MYC target genes by nuclear Pfn1 could be 2-fold. The significant downregulation of genes involved in proliferation (e.g., E2F targets) and metastasis (e.g., EMT) by XPO6 loss is consistent with the known anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects of Pfn1 in different tumor models and suggests that these effects originate, at least partially, from its nuclear function as an inhibitor of SEC-dependent transcription. It was intriguing to observe the significant downregulation of additional gene sets, as a result of XPO6 loss, that are functionally associated with diverse cellular processes including protein translation, oxidative phosphorylation, and adipogenesis as well as those associated with reactive oxygen species pathways and stem cell signatures, all of which have been positively linked to MYC activation. Consistent with the role of the SEC as a transcriptional activator, nearly all the significantly enriched gene sets and biological pathways represent downregulated genes due to XPO6 loss. The only notable exception was an upregulation of two H3K27me3 gene sets representing repressed target genes of the oncogenic histone methyltransferase EZH2, which coincide with a downregulation of its activated target genes. It was previously shown that MYC stimulates EZH2 expression both transcriptionally as a target gene and post-transcriptionally by repressing its negative regulator miR-26. Thus, the effect of XPO6 loss on EZH2 function may be similarly, and at least partially, caused by MYC repression due to SEC inhibition.",

By finding that nuclear Pfn1, the cargo of XPO6, is a physical binding partner and functional inhibitor of the SEC, we defined a moonlighting function of nuclear Pfn1 in transcriptional repression that is mechanistically linked to its poorly understood anticancer function. Our work highlights the importance of subcellular localization in protein function and the oncogenic effects of protein spatial deregulation that may arise due to aberrant expression of nucleocytoplasmic transporters. Future studies to expand our knowledge of spatially dynamic, multi-functional proteins such as Pfn1 are warranted and will likely unveil hidden biology, as well as therapeutic opportunities to treat cancer.",

For ER-positive MCF-7 cells, estrogen pellets (17beta estradiol, 0.75 mg/pellet, 90 days release; Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL) were implanted subcutaneously a day before tumor cell implantation. MCF-7 cells stably expressing XPO6(WT) and XPO6 (RNAi-Res) and infected with shLUC or shXPO6#3, were trypsinized, washed with and re-suspended in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), and mixed at a 1:1 ratio with Matrigel (356237, BD Biosciences). 5 x 106 (in 75 mul) cells were injected bilaterally into the 4th mammary glands of each mouse (6 mice/group). For ER-MDA-MB-231 cells stably infected with lentiCRISPRv2.0 lacking (control) or containing sgXPO6 #1 or #3, 1.7 x 106 in 75 mul were injected bilaterally into the 4th mammary fad pads of female nude mice without estrogen pellets (10 mice per group). Tumor volumes were measured bi-weekly by Caliper. Tumor volumes were calculated using the formula: tumor volume [mm3] = 1/2 x (tumor length) x (tumor width)2 . For MCF-7 cells, the experiment was terminated at 11 weeks post injection when the largest tumors reached around 1.5cm in diameter. For MDA-MB-231 cells, mice in each group were randomly divided into vehicle and JQ1 treatment groups (3-5 mice per group depending on the numbers of tumor-bearing mice) when the average tumor volume reached approximately 70mm3. JQ1 (S7110, Selleckchem) was freshly prepared each day by diluting 10x stock solution (0.5 mg/6 mul, 83.3mg/ml, in DMSO) into 1x working solution (0.05 mg/6 mul) using vehicle (10% hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin in 0.9% sodium chloride).
