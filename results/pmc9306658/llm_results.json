In cancer, this highly organised and precisely regulated network is disrupted, hijacked or reprogrammed resulting in oncogenic protein-protein interactions (oncoPPIs). OncoPPIs, which can result from genomic alterations, are a hallmark of many types of cancers. Recent technological advances in the field of mass spectrometry (MS)-based interactomics, structural biology and drug discovery have prompted scientists to identify and characterise oncoPPIs. Disruption of oncoPPI interfaces has become a major focus of drug discovery programs and has resulted in the use of PPI-specific drugs clinically. However, due to several technical hurdles, studies to build a reference oncoPPI map for various cancer types have not been undertaken. Therefore, there is an urgent need for experimental workflows to overcome the existing challenges in studying oncoPPIs in various cancers and to build comprehensive reference maps. Here, we discuss the important hurdles for characterising oncoPPIs and propose a three-phase multidisciplinary workflow to identify and characterise oncoPPIs. Systematic identification of cancer-type-specific oncogenic interactions will spur new opportunities for PPI-focused drug discovery projects and precision medicine.",

These modalities often lack selectivity which can lead to adverse effects such as chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. Quality of life in surviving patients is thereby compromised. In contrast, targeted molecular therapies offer a great potential to combat various cancer types with minimal harm to normal cells or organs. The main purpose of molecular therapy in oncology is to target specific biological pathways activated by oncoproteins in tumour cells. Oncoproteins are involved in various signalling pathways and mediate a large number of oncogenic protein-protein interactions (oncoPPIs).

Recent large-scale genome-wide analysis of 33 different cancer types involving 10 000 tumour samples reported that 55% (ie, 142 out of 258) of cancer genes and their mutations are associated with a single cancer. This strongly suggests that oncoPPI networks could be unique for many cancer types as their cancer driver genes and genomic alterations vary. Here, we define oncoPPIs as any direct PPIs that arise from genomic alterations in tumour cells. Identification and characterisation of oncoPPIs for each cancer can guide targeted molecular therapies and precision medicine. In the following sections, we discuss the genomic alterations and approaches to build reference oncoPPI maps for various cancers.",

(A) Schematic illustration of edgetic perturbation and node removal in cancer and their impact on normal protein interaction networks. Missense mutations are depicted as coloured stars. Specific interactions can be interrupted (dotted line, blue star) or enhanced (thick line, brown star) or created (green star) by a missense mutation, whereas complete loss of the node protein (dotted circle) leads to the loss of the entire interaction network. (B) Gene dysregulation is another source of oncogenic network formation. In normal cells (upper panel), Gene 1 (ie, oncogene) is inactive whereas Gene 2 (ie, tumour suppressor) is active and normPPIs occur. In cancer (lower panel), Gene 1 is activated and initiates oncoPPIs whilst Gene 2 is silenced and normPPIs are lost. (C) Genome organising proteins such as CTCF regulate genome folding globally in a highly organised manner. In cancer, CTCF binding sites or CTCF itself can be mutated leading to loss of CTCF occupancy. This causes disorganisation of genome architecture and dysregulation of neighbouring genes. Dysregulated genes can potentially define new interaction networks. (D) In cancer, mislocalisation of proteins can also initiate new interaction networks. For example, MUC1 and EGFR are normally expressed separately at the cell surface. However, in cancer, MUC1 forms oncogenic PPIs with EGFR, regulating its nuclear localisation and hence transcriptional regulation of target genes",

Further characterisation of some of the variants confirmed that disease-associated variants disrupt PPIs and regulate tumour growth.

Approximately, 70% of the missense mutations had no effect on protein stability and folding, however half of these mutations resulted in edgetic perturbation.

These mutations can lead to transcriptional activation or repression of the target genes. For example, the promoter region of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is frequently mutated in a range of cancers and linked to increased tumour growth and metastasis (Figure 1B). Genomic alterations can also occur in trans-regulatory elements, distant from cis-regulatory elements of the given cancer genes. For instance, mutations or structural variations in DNA motifs bound by genome-organising proteins, such as CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin, or transcription factors, indirectly lead to the dysregulation of many genes in various cancers (Figure 1C). Mutations that occur within topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries or in enhancer and insulator regions can result in coordinated dysregulation of a cluster of neighbouring genes located within the same TAD.

Such aberrant activation of proteins can potentiate illicit oncoPPIs and redefine the oncogenic potential of cancer cells. As another example, the aberrant expression of CTCF-like (CTCFL), a paralogue of CTCF, in treatment-resistant neuroblastoma alters genome folding and leads to the formation of superenhancers that consequently activate proneural proteins and promote a resistance phenotype. Another example is the bromodomain (BRD)-containing protein family members, which are readers of lysine acetylation, that are highly elevated in many cancers.

However, the subcellular relocalisation of the proteins as a rapid cellular response to internal or environmental stimuli can elicit new protein interaction networks. An exemplar is the receptor tyrosine-protein kinase HER2, an oncogene associated with progression of aggressive types of breast cancer. HER2 is expressed on the cell surface where it can function as a receptor or can localise to the nucleus upon stimulation to modulate transcription of target genes. Another example is alpha-enolase (ENO1), a potential prognostic marker which is elevated in various types of cancers and is linked to tumourigenesis. ENO1 can exhibit distinct functions in different cellular locations: (a) as a gene transcriptional repressor in the nucleus, where it exhibits enzymatic function in the cytosol regulating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signalling pathway; and (b) as a plasminogen receptor in the plasma membrane. Similarly, mucin-1 (MUC1), a well-characterised oncoprotein extensively expressed on the surface of cancer cells, is also expressed in the nucleus, cytosol and mitochondria, and has been shown to interact with different protein partners in a location-dependent manner. When MUC1 is localised to the nucleus in breast cancer cells it interacts with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), facilitating chromatin binding and thereby rewiring oncogenic pathways (Figure 1D).

            "text": "AP-MS is widely used to purify and characterise interactors of a protein of interest from a complex cell lysate mixture. In AP-MS, either an immunoprecipitation-grade antibody is immobilised onto a solid-phase support and then is mixed with cell lysates to capture the target protein and its interactors, or the bait protein is either endogenously or ectopically tagged with epitopes (eg, FLAG, HA and myc) and used to capture interactions. AP-MS using an epitope-tagged approach offers an excellent opportunity to undertake deep and region-specific interactome studies for most proteins. The most comprehensive human interactome, BioPlex 3.0, has been constructed using this approach. In this project, ~15 000 genes were dual-tagged with FLAG and HA epitopes and stably overexpressed in HEK293 cells. Affinity-purified complexes were subjected to MS and network analysis. However, such interactome maps will not distinguish normPPIs from oncoPPIs. To do this, the protein of interest should be compared in both cancer and matched normal cell lines or organoids. For example, RAS gene family members HRAS, KRAS and NRAS carry missense mutations or display dysregulated expression patterns in various cancers and convey aberrant interaction networks. Therefore, affinity purification and interactome studies of RAS family members or their mutants from both cancer and paired normal cells in pancreatic cancer or other cancers can extract more informative interaction networks and oncogenic pathways (Figure 2). Likewise, a different interaction profile might be observed for a panel of well-known oncoproteins and tumour suppressors. Together, this approach will not only facilitate the comprehensive definition of the oncogenic map of cancer driver proteins in a tissue-specific manner but will also enable identification of novel tissue-specific normPPIs that have not been reported before. The novel PPIs can be reported in interaction repositories such as BioGRID.",

These include proximity-dependent biotin-identification (BioID) and ascorbate peroxidase (APEX)-based methods or derivatives of these. These approaches were initially developed to overcome the limitations of AP-MS approaches, in which mild lysis conditions may limit protein solubility and therefore accessibility. Furthermore, weak and transient interactions, especially interactions involved in cell signalling, may remain undetected. Therefore PL-MS is very useful to identify highly dynamic interactions that occur in various biological processes such as the cell cycle, transcription and translation initiation, elongation and termination. BioID, the most widely used approach over the past decade utilises engineered BirA enzymes that are covalently linked to a protein of interest to catalyse the conversion of biotin and ATP into highly reactive biotinoyl-5'-AMP molecules which bind lysine residues on neighbouring proteins. Proteins within a 10 nm radius are labelled depending on the type of fused BirA enzyme and duration. Most recently, a BioID-based approach was used to define the interaction map for 4000 proteins within various intracellular compartments highlighting BioID as a powerful tool for profiling PPIs in different organelles and compartments of live cells.",

Dissecting diversity, low binding affinities and the sensitivity of binding properties to minor sequence variation represent major challenges.

Similarly, interrogation of the oncogenic KRAS G12V interactome using BioID coupled to a CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen revealed phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase PIP5K1A as the most negatively enriched target. PIP5K1A depletion reduced KRAS-dependent proliferation and signalling in several pancreatic cancer cell lines, thus providing a potential drug target for the treatment of KRAS-mutant cancers.

Genomic characterisation of human tumours has led to the generation of vast amounts of high-resolution sequencing data. These data have enabled identification of many cancer-driver genes that are involved in the initiation and progression of tumour cells. However, it remains a challenging task to determine how these genomic signatures can be exploited to develop new therapies. Most cancer-driver genes or oncogenes, discovered to date, are essential for cell growth and maintenance pathways in both healthy and disease states. Therefore, exploiting them as new drug targets may result in adverse effects by perturbing normal physiological pathways. Given that proteins exert their function mostly through interaction with other proteins, it is highly plausible that targeting cancer-specific oncoPPIs could be a more advantageous approach which may result in a better clinical outcome with minimal side effects. Thus, a focus on generating a comprehensive map of the oncoPPI networks for various human cancers will stimulate targeted drug discovery efforts and will shed more insight into protein networks governing tumour growth.",
