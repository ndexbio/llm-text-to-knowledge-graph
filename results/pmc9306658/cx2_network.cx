Genomic characterisation of human tumours has led to the generation of vast amounts of high-resolution sequencing data. These data have enabled identification of many cancer-driver genes that are involved in the initiation and progression of tumour cells. However, it remains a challenging task to determine how these genomic signatures can be exploited to develop new therapies. Most cancer-driver genes or oncogenes, discovered to date, are essential for cell growth and maintenance pathways in both healthy and disease states. Therefore, exploiting them as new drug targets may result in adverse effects by perturbing normal physiological pathways. Given that proteins exert their function mostly through interaction with other proteins, it is highly plausible that targeting cancer-specific oncoPPIs could be a more advantageous approach which may result in a better clinical outcome with minimal side effects. Thus, a focus on generating a comprehensive map of the oncoPPI networks for various human cancers will stimulate targeted drug discovery efforts and will shed more insight into protein networks governing tumour growth.",

In cancer, this highly organised and precisely regulated network is disrupted, hijacked or reprogrammed resulting in oncogenic protein-protein interactions (oncoPPIs). OncoPPIs, which can result from genomic alterations, are a hallmark of many types of cancers. Recent technological advances in the field of mass spectrometry (MS)-based interactomics, structural biology and drug discovery have prompted scientists to identify and characterise oncoPPIs. Disruption of oncoPPI interfaces has become a major focus of drug discovery programs and has resulted in the use of PPI-specific drugs clinically. However, due to several technical hurdles, studies to build a reference oncoPPI map for various cancer types have not been undertaken. Therefore, there is an urgent need for experimental workflows to overcome the existing challenges in studying oncoPPIs in various cancers and to build comprehensive reference maps. Here, we discuss the important hurdles for characterising oncoPPIs and propose a three-phase multidisciplinary workflow to identify and characterise oncoPPIs. Systematic identification of cancer-type-specific oncogenic interactions will spur new opportunities for PPI-focused drug discovery projects and precision medicine."

These modalities often lack selectivity which can lead to adverse effects such as chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. Quality of life in surviving patients is thereby compromised. In contrast, targeted molecular therapies offer a great potential to combat various cancer types with minimal harm to normal cells or organs. The main purpose of molecular therapy in oncology is to target specific biological pathways activated by oncoproteins in tumour cells. Oncoproteins are involved in various signalling pathways and mediate a large number of oncogenic protein-protein interactions (oncoPPIs). OncoPPI interfaces offer great potential for rational drug development and targeted cancer therapy."

The number of large-scale studies reporting the effects of coding mutations on disease-specific PPI networks has increased rapidly. A recent comprehensive investigation of over 10 000 tumour exomes demonstrated that disease-associated germline variants as well as somatic missense mutations are significantly enriched in PPI interfaces compared to germline variants found in healthy individuals. Further characterisation of some of the variants confirmed that disease-associated variants disrupt PPIs and regulate tumour growth. In a large-scale study using the binary Y2H system, PPIs were assessed for ~2500 pathogenic missense mutations. Approximately, 70% of the missense mutations had no effect on protein stability and folding, however half of these mutations resulted in edgetic perturbation. In a comprehensive assessment of somatic missense mutations within 304 cancer-specific PPI interfaces for which structural data was available, 16 interfaces (~5%) were disrupted."

Consequently, the RAS signalling pathway was disrupted leading to enhanced cell proliferation and tumour growth. In another study, it was shown that a missense mutation, R183W, in serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit 1A (PPP2R1A) disrupted its binding to the canonical subunits of the PP2A complex B module, including B55 and B56 proteins, and abrogated growth suppressive effects.

Mouse tumour organoids have also been used for functional validation of PPI inhibitors, Poloppin and Poloppin-II, which inhibit Polo-like kinase interactions. Although patient-derived organoids are technically challenging and costly, the ability to gain a more clinically relevant understanding of a patient's tumour outweighs these challenges in the search for effective targeted therapies."

In AP-MS, either an immunoprecipitation-grade antibody is immobilised onto a solid-phase support and then is mixed with cell lysates to capture the target protein and its interactors, or the bait protein is either endogenously or ectopically tagged with epitopes (eg, FLAG, HA and myc) and used to capture interactions. AP-MS using an epitope-tagged approach offers an excellent opportunity to undertake deep and region-specific interactome studies for most proteins. The most comprehensive human interactome, BioPlex 3.0, has been constructed using this approach. In this project, ~15 000 genes were dual-tagged with FLAG and HA epitopes and stably overexpressed in HEK293 cells. Affinity-purified complexes were subjected to MS and network analysis. However, such interactome maps will not distinguish normPPIs from oncoPPIs. To do this, the protein of interest should be compared in both cancer and matched normal cell lines or organoids. For example, RAS gene family members HRAS, KRAS and NRAS carry missense mutations or display dysregulated expression patterns in various cancers and convey aberrant interaction networks. Therefore, affinity purification and interactome studies of RAS family members or their mutants from both cancer and paired normal cells in pancreatic cancer or other cancers can extract more informative interaction networks and oncogenic pathways (Figure 2). Likewise, a different interaction profile might be observed for a panel of well-known oncoproteins and tumour suppressors. Together, this approach will not only facilitate the comprehensive definition of the oncogenic map of cancer driver proteins in a tissue-specific manner but will also enable identification of novel tissue-specific normPPIs that have not been reported before. The novel PPIs can be reported in interaction repositories such as BioGRID."

Over 1800 PBDs have been reported, which indicate their diversity and importance in mediating transient interactions. Dissecting diversity, low binding affinities and the sensitivity of binding properties to minor sequence variation represent major challenges. In cancer, somatic mutations can commonly occur in PBD-containing proteins and many of these proteins are drug targets. BioID could be an ideal method to study the transient interactome of oncoproteins containing PBDs in different cancers."

Genomic characterisation of human tumours has led to the generation of vast amounts of high-resolution sequencing data.

However, it remains a challenging task to determine how these genomic signatures can be exploited to develop new therapies. Most cancer-driver genes or oncogenes, discovered to date, are essential for cell growth and maintenance pathways in both healthy and disease states. Therefore, exploiting them as new drug targets may result in adverse effects by perturbing normal physiological pathways. Given that proteins exert their function mostly through interaction with other proteins, it is highly plausible that targeting cancer-specific oncoPPIs could be a more advantageous approach which may result in a better clinical outcome with minimal side effects. Thus, a focus on generating a comprehensive map of the oncoPPI networks for various human cancers will stimulate targeted drug discovery efforts and will shed more insight into protein networks governing tumour growth."
