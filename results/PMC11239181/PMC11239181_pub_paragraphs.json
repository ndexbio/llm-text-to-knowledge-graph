        "text": "In addition to the unexpected finding that DDX6 translationally represses a specific group of endogenous transcripts, we reasoned that we should also find potential targets of DDX6-mediated mRNA decay in the group of mRNAs that are more abundant in the absence of DDX6. Based on our previous observations that DDX6 mediates decay of inefficiently translated mRNAs, we further reasoned that we could use the ribosome profiling data to identify upregulated mRNAs with locally increased ribosome occupancy, indicative of slow elongation rates (overview Figure 3:figure supplement 2A). We manually screened the list of transcripts with logFC >1 and a statistically significant change (FDR <0.005) in the RNA-seq experiment (298 transcripts) for the presence of a local increase of ribosome footprints as measured by the coupled ribosome profiling experiment and found 35 genes that matched these criteria (Figure 3:figure supplement 2B-G and Material and methods). It is worth mentioning that one of the most highly upregulated mRNAs in DDX6 KO cells is the androgen receptor (AR) transcript containing CAG repeats, coding for a stretch of glutamine repeats (poly Q). The repetitive nature of this sequence makes it difficult to determine whether inefficient translation elongation occurs during decoding. However, it is interesting to note that a recent preprint suggests that CAG expansions can cause altered elongation kinetics that can lead to CAG expansion diseases like Huntington's disease. Repetitive codon sequences potentially lead to ribosome stalling because of limited tRNA availability. Given the repetitive nature of the transcript, we hypothesized that AR mRNA could be a direct DDX6 target. We then used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to measure the levels of selected transcripts in WT, DDX6 KO cells, and DDX6 KO cells expressing either WT or mutant DDX6 exogenously. DDX6 dependency was detected in 6 of the 9 tested mRNAs (Figure 3H and Figure 3:figure supplement 3A AR, BMP2, LGALS1, DLX5, ENO2, PSMB9; see also changes in mRNA abundance as determined by RNA-seq; note that especially for AR and ENO2 the changes in mRNA abundance appear to be underestimated by the qPCR analysis compared to the RNA-seq quantification which can possibly arise due to differences in normalization strategies of the different technologies or exact sample status). The following three potential DDX6 targets were not confirmed: C1QTNF4, CALCB, and PCK1. We observed that DDX6 KO cells had higher levels of target mRNAs compared to WT HEK293T cells, as also measured by the RNA-seq experiments, and were partially restored back to WT levels by expressing exogenous DDX6. The partial rescue might be explained by uneven transfection efficiency and/or additional time required to reach base line mRNA levels. It should be noted that none of the mutant forms of DDX6 were able to restore target mRNA levels, consistent with the previous reporter experiments. All proteins were expressed at equivalent levels (Figure 3I). These results strongly suggest that DDX6 plays a direct role in the regulation of target mRNA levels in HEK293T cells."

        "text": "To test whether the identified translational pause sites in some of the endogenous DDX6-targeted mRNAs contribute to mRNA destabilization, we created different reporter constructs in which the putative ribosomal stalling region (RSR) was inserted downstream of the Renilla luciferase open reading frame, either preceding or following a stop-codon; R-LUC-RSR and R-LUC-stop-RSR, respectively (Figure 4A). These constructs were designed to differentiate translation-dependent regulation from translation-independent effects, triggered for example by binding of trans-regulatory factors (e.g. RNA-binding proteins or miRNAs) to the introduced sequence. We tested two of the sequences identified in our screen for DDX6-destabilized mRNAs: first, a stretch containing 23 'CAG' codon repeats (encoding 23 x Q) mimicking the X-chromosome encoded AR gene. For the second sequence, we chose a 30 nt stretch of the bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) gene encoded on chromosome 20, which codes for a sequence of basic amino acids (QRKRLKSSCK). Polybasic amino acid stretches and prolines have been reported to cause ribosome stalling. Since the sequence immediately adjacent to the actual stall site also contained several lysine, arginine, and proline codons, we cloned the stalling sequence with 100 nt upstream and downstream flanking regions to include all potential contributing regulatory elements in the reporter constructs. We then measured the half-lives of the reporter constructs when transfected into HEK293T cells. For this, reporter mRNA was quantified by northern blot at different time points after transcription was blocked using actinomycin D. As expected, the presence of the AR stalling sequence before the stop-codon strongly reduced the mRNA half-life compared to the control mRNA where the stop-codon precedes the stalling sequence (Figure 4B and C). The same was true for the BMP2 stalling sequence: the presence of the stalling sequence was associated with a strong translation-dependent reduction in mRNA half-life (4.0+-1.9 hr compared to >10 hr in the control vector) (Figure 4D and E). To test whether the observed reduction in reporter mRNA stability containing endogenous ribosomal stalling sites was dependent on DDX6, we also performed the half-life measurements in HEK293T DDX6 KO cells, and observed that the R-LUC-stop and R-LUC constructs for both AR and BMP2 stalling sequences had similar half-lives (Figure 4B-E). These results, therefore, confirm that DDX6 is required to trigger the co-translational mRNA decay induced by these sequences."
