Aliquots of the Nluc substrate/inhibitor master mix (100 microl) were added to 50 microl of the supernatant fraction obtained from the medium-speed centrifugation. The mixture was briefly vortexed, and luminescence was measured using a Promega GlowMax 20/20 Luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Following luminescence measurements, 1.5 microl of 10% TX-100 was added to each reaction tube to achieve a final concentration of 0.1% TX-100. Samples were vortexed briefly, and luminescence was measured again. For intracellular normalization, the luminescence of 50 microl of cell lysate was measured using the Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The exosome production index (EPI) for each sample was calculated using the formula: EPI = ([medium] - [medium +0.1% TX-100])/cell lysate."

        "text": "In the parkin-GFP cells, is miR223 also accumulated in mitochondria, and how does the CCCP treatment affect this localization? I would have expected the disappearance (degradation) of miR223 together with the disappearance of mitochondria in the CCCP condition, but the miR223 quantification in cells suggests instead an accumulation in the cytosol: can the authors document this hypothesis by immunofluorescence as in Figure 3A? Concerning the EV/exosome release, I would expect the mitochondrial absence to globally prevent the release of EVs (because of lack of energy), rather than specifically controlling miR223 targeting EVs."
