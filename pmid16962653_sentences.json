We found that phosphorylation of FoxO1/3a (also called FKHR/FKHRL1) (Greer and Brunet, 2005), was affected in SIN1\u2212/\u2212 cells. In particular, phosphorylation of FoxO1/3a at Thr24/Thr32 was significantly decreased in the absence of SIN1 under normal growing and restimulated conditions (Figure 4A)."

These results indicate that Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation is required for FoxO1/3a phosphorylation at Thr24/32."
