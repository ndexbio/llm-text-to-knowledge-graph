# general prompt

"""
Extract all molecular interactions from the provided scientific text. The subject should be the first molecular entity interacting with the second molecular entity, which is the object. The activity between the two entities should be specified by the interaction type. An interaction must relate a subject to an object, this means, an interaction would always be between only two entities. Do not extract anything that is not a BIOLOGICAL ENTITY.
For each sentence, Convert mentions of genes and proteins to their official HGNC symbols.


Use the following interaction types and their descriptions from the INDRA database and state the relationships in the indra format.

Biological Domain:
- Complex: Formation of a complex between two or more biological entities.
- Modification: General modifications, which can include various post-translational modifications.
- SelfModification: Modifications where an entity modifies itself.
- RegulateActivity: Regulation of the activity of a molecule (e.g., activation or inhibition).
- RegulateAmount: Regulation of the amount of a molecule (e.g., increase or decrease in amount).
- ActiveForm: A molecule being in an active form.
- Translocation: Movement of a molecule from one location to another within a cell.
- Gef: Guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity.
- Gap: GTPase-activating protein activity.
- Conversion: Conversion of one molecule to another.

Post-Translational Modifications (subtypes of Modification):
- Phosphorylation: Addition of a phosphate group.
- Dephosphorylation: Removal of a phosphate group.
- Ubiquitination: Attachment of ubiquitin.
- Deubiquitination: Removal of ubiquitin.
- Sumoylation: Attachment of SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier).
- Desumoylation: Removal of SUMO.
- Hydroxylation: Addition of a hydroxyl group.
- Dehydroxylation: Removal of a hydroxyl group.
- Acetylation: Addition of an acetyl group.
- Deacetylation: Removal of an acetyl group.
- Glycosylation: Addition of a glycosyl group.
- Deglycosylation: Removal of a glycosyl group.
- Farnesylation: Addition of a farnesyl group.
- Defarnesylation: Removal of a farnesyl group.
- Geranylgeranylation: Addition of a geranylgeranyl group.
- Degeranylgeranylation: Removal of a geranylgeranyl group.
- Palmitoylation: Addition of a palmitoyl group.
- Depalmitoylation: Removal of a palmitoyl group.
- Myristoylation: Addition of a myristoyl group.
- Demyristoylation: Removal of a myristoyl group.
- Ribosylation: Addition of a ribosyl group.
- Deribosylation: Removal of a ribosyl group.
- Methylation: Addition of a methyl group.
- Demethylation: Removal of a methyl group.

Subtypes of SelfModification:
- Autophosphorylation: Self-addition of a phosphate group.
- Transphosphorylation: Transfer of a phosphate group between two molecules.

Subtypes of RegulateActivity:
- Activation: Increase in the activity of a molecule.
- Inhibition: Decrease in the activity of a molecule.

Subtypes of RegulateAmount:
- IncreaseAmount: Increase in the amount of a molecule.
- DecreaseAmount: Decrease in the amount of a molecule.

For each interaction, provide the following details:
- subject: The first molecular entity involved in the interaction.
- object: The second molecular entity involved in the interaction.
- interaction_type: The type of interaction from the list above.
- text: The exact sentence from which the interaction was extracted.
- direct: True if there is a direct relationship/interaction between the subject and object.
- hypothesis: True if the interaction is suggested by the authors.
