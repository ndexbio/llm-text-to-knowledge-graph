SET Evidence = "Stat5 protein levels were elevated by 8 h and remained elevated until 72 h after R5020
treatment with increases of 4–7-fold (Fig. 1A). To test the PR dependence
of this effect, the experiment was repeated using PR-negative T47D-Y cells (28)
(Fig. 1B). In the absence of PR, R5020 did not up-regulate Stat5."

amounts of protein were probed with antibody recognizing total Stat5 (Fig. 4A).
In untreated cells, Stat5 was exclusively cytoplasmic (lane 1); no Stat5 was found
in the nucleus (lane 2). As expected, EGF treatment promoted nuclear translocation
of a portion of Stat5 (lanes 5 and 6). Surprisingly, R5020 not only increased
total Stat5 levels (lanes 3  and 4; 7and 8), but also promoted extensive nuclear
translocation of Stat5 (compare lanes 2 and 4) independent of EGF treatment."

that were pretreated with R5020 for 48 h, prior to the 10-min prolactin treatment
(P-Stat5, lane 6). Prolactin alone had no effect (lane 3) nor did transient
(1 h) or chronic (48 h) R5020 treatment (lane 2). Thus, in T47Dco cells, Stat5 phosphorylation
by prolactin requires progesterone pretreatment."

SET Evidence = "The β-casein promoter, known to be induced by Stat5 when activated by prolactin via
prolactin receptors and JAK2, was next used to test the function of the phosphorylated
Stat5. T47D-YB cells were pretreated with either R5020 or ethanol vehicle
for 48 h. Cells were then washed, transfected with a β-casein promoter-luciferase
reporter, treated with either R5020 or prolactin, and harvested for luciferase
assay 24 h after hormone treatment. We found that in T47D-YB breast cancer
cells, prolactin alone has minimal to no significant effect on the β-casein luciferase
promoter. However, after R5020 pretreatment, a 6–7-fold induction of the
β-casein luciferase promoter was observed (Fig.7B). Thus R5020 sensitized these
breast cancer cells to the transcriptional effects of prolactin mediated through
Stat5."
