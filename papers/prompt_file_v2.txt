# general prompt

"""
Instructions:
You will be given a scientific text broken down into sentences that contains biological interactions between molecular entities. You are required to act like an expert in bioinformatics that has deep knowledge about genes, proteins and biological terms. You are to go through each sentence and take note of all the molecular entities resolving them to standard, official identifiers (such as HGNC official gene symbols or GO terms) where possible. An interaction must relate at least two entities together. Note that some sentences may not contain any biological interaction, this means that such a sentence should be skipped.

Task:
Analyze the provided scientific sentences using the following steps:
1. Extract the molecular interactions from each sentence that is provided. An interaction must always relate the first molecular entity to another molecular entity. DO NOT extract anything that is not a molecular entity
2. The subject should be the first molecular entity interacting with the second molecular entity, which is the object. The activity between the two entities should be specified by the interaction type.
3. Then, state the relationships between entities in knowledge graph format, using the INDRA vocabulary where appropriate. The indra vocabulary is specified in the heading interaction types below.

Interaction types:
These are the relationships that can be used in an interaction
Biological Domain:
- Complex: Formation of a complex between two or more biological entities.
- Modification: General modifications, which can include various post-translational modifications.
- SelfModification: Modifications where an entity modifies itself.
- RegulateActivity: Regulation of the activity of a molecule (e.g., activation or inhibition).
- RegulateAmount: Regulation of the amount of a molecule (e.g., increase or decrease in amount).
- ActiveForm: A molecule being in an active form.
- Translocation: Movement of a molecule from one location to another within a cell.
- Gef: Guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity.
- Gap: GTPase-activating protein activity.
- Conversion: Conversion of one molecule to another.


Post-Translational Modifications (subtypes of Modification):
- Phosphorylation: Addition of a phosphate group.
- Dephosphorylation: Removal of a phosphate group.
- Ubiquitination: Attachment of ubiquitin.
- Deubiquitination: Removal of ubiquitin.
- Sumoylation: Attachment of SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier).
- Desumoylation: Removal of SUMO.
- Hydroxylation: Addition of a hydroxyl group.
- Dehydroxylation: Removal of a hydroxyl group.
- Acetylation: Addition of an acetyl group.
- Deacetylation: Removal of an acetyl group.
- Glycosylation: Addition of a glycosyl group.
- Deglycosylation: Removal of a glycosyl group.
- Farnesylation: Addition of a farnesyl group.
- Defarnesylation: Removal of a farnesyl group.
- Geranylgeranylation: Addition of a geranylgeranyl group.
- Degeranylgeranylation: Removal of a geranylgeranyl group.
- Palmitoylation: Addition of a palmitoyl group.
- Depalmitoylation: Removal of a palmitoyl group.
- Myristoylation: Addition of a myristoyl group.
- Demyristoylation: Removal of a myristoyl group.
- Ribosylation: Addition of a ribosyl group.
- Deribosylation: Removal of a ribosyl group.
- Methylation: Addition of a methyl group.
- Demethylation: Removal of a methyl group.


Subtypes of SelfModification:
- Autophosphorylation: Self-addition of a phosphate group.
- Transphosphorylation: Transfer of a phosphate group between two molecules.


Subtypes of RegulateActivity:
- Activation: Increase in the activity of a molecule.
- Inhibition: Decrease in the activity of a molecule.


Subtypes of RegulateAmount:
- IncreaseAmount: Increase in the amount of a molecule.
- DecreaseAmount: Decrease in the amount of a molecule.

Output Format:
The output obtained from each sentence should be structured in the format below. For each interaction, provide the following details:
- subject: The first molecular entity involved in the interaction.
- object: The second molecular entity involved in the interaction.
- interaction_type: The type of interaction from the list above.
- text: The exact sentence from which the interaction was extracted.
- direct: True if there is a direct relationship/interaction between the subject and object.
- hypothesis: True if the interaction is suggested by the authors.

Example Formats:
Below are some examples of the kind of output I am expecting:
