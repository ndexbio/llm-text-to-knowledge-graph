# general prompt

"""
Instructions:
You will receive a scientific text with sentences detailing biological interactions between molecular entities. As an expert in bioinformatics with deep knowledge of genes, proteins, and biological terms, identify and resolve each molecular entity to standard identifiers (e.g., HGNC gene symbols, GO terms). Record interactions between pairs of entities, skipping sentences without interactions.

Thinking: 
Before recording any interactions, take a moment to consider each gene or protein and the interactions described in the paper. Understand the context and significance of these interactions. Ensure that any interaction recorded is accurate and meaningful, as the goal is to represent these interactions as knowledge graphs.

Task:
Analyze the provided scientific sentences using the following steps:
1. Find all the entities and normalize all genes/proteins to HGNC official gene symbols in the sentences provided. 
2. Find the interactions between the genes. An interaction must always relate the first molecular entity to another molecular entity. The subject should be the first molecular entity interacting with the second molecular entity, which is the object.
3. State the relationships between entities in knowledge graph format, using the INDRA vocabulary where appropriate. The indra vocabulary is specified in the heading interaction types below the last step.
Interaction types:
These are the relationships that can be used in an interaction
Biological Domain:
- Complex: Formation of a complex between two or more biological entities.
- Modification: General modifications, which can include various post-translational modifications.
- SelfModification: Modifications where an entity modifies itself.
- RegulateActivity: Regulation of the activity of a molecule (e.g., activation or inhibition).
- RegulateAmount: Regulation of the amount of a molecule (e.g., increase or decrease in amount).
- ActiveForm: A molecule being in an active form.
- Translocation: Movement of a molecule from one location to another within a cell.
- Gef: Guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity.

- Ribosylation: Addition of a ribosyl group.
- Deribosylation: Removal of a ribosyl group.
- Methylation: Addition of a methyl group.
- Demethylation: Removal of a methyl group.


Subtypes of SelfModification:
- Autophosphorylation: Self-addition of a phosphate group.
- Transphosphorylation: Transfer of a phosphate group between two molecules.


Subtypes of RegulateActivity:
- Activation: Increase in the activity of a molecule.
- Inhibition: Decrease in the activity of a molecule.


Subtypes of RegulateAmount:
- IncreaseAmount: Increase in the amount of a molecule.
- DecreaseAmount: Decrease in the amount of a molecule.


Output Format:
The output obtained from each sentence should be structured in the format below. For each interaction, provide the following details:
- subject: The first molecular entity involved in the interaction.
- object: The second molecular entity involved in the interaction.
- interaction_type: The type of interaction from the list above.
- text: The exact sentence from which the interaction was extracted.
- direct: True if there is a direct physical relationship/interaction between the subject and object.
- hypothesis: True if the interaction is speculated by the authors.


Example Formats:
Below are some examples of the kind of output I am expecting:

"subject": "EP300", "object": "PARP1", "interaction_type": "Acetylation", "text": "PARP1 is acetylated by p300 / CBP; this acetylation is involved in the activation of NF-\u03ba B by PARP1.", "direct": true, "hypothesis": false
