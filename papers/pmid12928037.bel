and apoptosis (programmed cell death) [1,2]"

SET Cell = "endothelial cell"
SET Evidence = "One such risk factor is oxLDL, which exert pro-apoptotic effects on a variety of cell
lineages, including endothelial cells and VSMCs, both in cultured cells and
in arteries [19–26]. Increased formation of oxygen radicals (and other radical
species) facilitates LDL oxidation and influences oxidation-sensitive mechanisms
[15]."

SET Evidence = "Not surprisingly, high concentrations of exogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS),
generated by enzymatic reactions or by radiation, also stimulate the apoptosis
of endothelial cells in vitro [29–31]."

SET Evidence = "The peptide hormone angiotensin II and pro-inflammatory cytokines also trigger the
apoptotic program in endothelial cells [33,34]."

SET Evidence = "Aging, one of the major predictors for atherosclerotic lesion formation, increases
the sensitivity of endothelial cells to apoptosis induced by in vitro and in vivo
stimuli [35–37]."

bp(GOBP:aging) increases bp(GOBP:"apoptotic process")

SET Evidence = "Shear stress enhances expression of the gene encoding the endothelial nitric oxide
synthase (eNOS) and further stimulates its enzymatic activity, leading to physiologic
low concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) within endothelial cells [44–46].
This continuous generation of NO prevents the apoptosis of endothelial cells,
thereby protecting the endothelial monolayer from injury [47,48]."

in experimental and human studies [46,49]."

SET Anatomy = "cardiovascular system endothelium"
SET Evidence = "OxLDL induces the generation of ROS in different vascular cell types [15,58], and
might also promote a rise in ROS levels through a decrease in ROS degradation,
because oxLDL induces a reduction in the antioxidant enzymes Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase
[59] and glutathione peroxidase [60]."

SET Evidence = "For instance, during 7-ketocholesterol-induced apoptosis of U937 cells, the cellular
antioxidant content falls rapidly [64], but administration of two potent antioxidants,
the aminothiols glutathione and N-acetylcysteine, can protect themonocytic
cells from 7-ketocholesterol-induced apoptotic cell death [64]."

triggered by hydrogen peroxide [27,65]."

SET Evidence = "The proto-oncogene c-myc can promote cell death (probably mediated through p53) or
cell proliferation, depending on its expression level. It functions as a nuclear
phosphoprotein with particular properties of a transcription factor [68,69].
In serum deprived cultures, cells overexpressing c-myc readily undergo apoptosis.
In addition, deregulation of c-myc causes apoptosis of VSMCs deprived of growth
factors or treated with cytokines such as interferon-g [70]."

SET Evidence = "Tissue factor (TF) is a 47 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein that initiates blood coagulation
by binding coagulation factor VII and its activated form (factor VIIa),
to produce a high-affinity complex [72] that proteolytically activates factors
IX and X, leading to thrombin generation."

SET CellStructure = "Cell Membrane"
SET Evidence = "TF works at the surface of cell membranes, and its activity is highly dependent on
the presence of phosphatidylserine (PS), an anionic phospholipid that is redistributed
on the cell surface during apoptotic death and confers a potent pro-coagulant
activity to the apoptotic cell [74]."
