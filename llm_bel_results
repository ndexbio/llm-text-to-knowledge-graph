There are four serotypes of the virus. Each serotype is antigenically different, meaning they elicit heterologous antibodies. Infection with one serotype will create neutralizing antibodies to the serotype. Cross-protection from other serotypes is not long term, instead heterotypic infection can cause severe disease. This review will focus on the innate immune response to DENV infection and the virus evasion of the innate immune system by escaping recognition or inhibiting the production of an antiviral state. Activated innate immune pathways includes type I interferon, complement, apoptosis, and autophagy, which the virus can evade or exploit to exacerbate disease. It is important to understand out how the immune system reacts to infection and how the virus evades immune response in order to develop effective antivirals and vaccines.",

Secondary infections, however, are known to cause severe disease, specifically after a heterotypic infection. The exact cause of this is unknown, but the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) may cause increased pathogenicity and virulence. ADE occurs when antibodies from a previous heterotypic infection do not neutralize a secondary infection with a different subtype but still bind to viral proteins. This creates a virus-antibody complex phagocytosed by cells that are not usually infected via Fcgamma receptors, specifically monocytes via FcgammaIIa receptor. This results in increased viremia and pathology. Severe disease is seen in only 1% of DENV cases; however, mortality in severe cases can have a rate of up to 20%",

The NS1 dimer is located on the lumen side of the ER, yet it plays an essential role in viral RNA replication, since deletion of NS1 from the viral genome inhibits replication. Through transmembrane interaction with NS4a and NS4b, NS1 will help form vesicles for virus replication, called the viral replication complex (RC), and colocalize with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (Fig. 1). It also modulates infectious virus particle production by interacting with structural proteins prM/E. NS4a plays a role in membrane alteration, in order to form the RC.

Virus-induced mitochondria damage activates the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) (pink arrows) and stimulator of interferon gene (STING) pathway to induce IFNalpha/beta production via IRF3 and IRF7. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) associate with RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) in the cytoplasm to target viral RNA for inhibition or degradation. miRNA biogenesis starts in the nucleus as pri-miRNA and processed by Drosha into pre-miRNA. Pre-miRNAs are transported to the cytoplasm and cleaved by Dicer to produce mature miRNAs. Argonaute (Argo) and TAR RNA-binding protein (TRBP) are proteins essential to the formation of RISC (blue arrows).

Double membrane vacuoles, called autophagosomes, will engulf cytoplasmic material and fuse with the lysosome for degradation. Thus, autophagy is an important system to clearing the host of foreign pathogens such as viruses. Autophagy has been shown to be activated in DENV infections and has antiviral or pro-viral activity depending on cell type. Autophagy inhibits replication in monocytes, specifically under ADE conditions, which make these cells highly susceptible to infection. Reticulophagy, a selective autophagy process for ER homeostasis, reduces DENV via its FAM134B receptor in endothelial cells. In liver cells, autophagy has a pro-viral effect. DENV blocks the autophagosome from fusing with the lysosome, and instead uses the vacuoles for replication, assembly and maturation, and evading neutralizing antibodies during transmission.",

NS4b suppresses the RNAi pathway in mammalian cells by blocking Dicer processing via transmembrane domain 3 (TMD3) and TMD5, preventing the biogenesis of mRNA; this is independent of the N-terminal domain that is associated with IFN suppression. NS3 will also block RNAi by binding to heat-shock cognate 70, an essential protein for creating RISC, and inhibit TRBP-Argo interaction and RISC formation (Fig. 4). DENV NS2b/3 protease inhibits reticulophagy (selective autophagy of the ER) by cleaving FAM134B, an essential receptor for reticulophagy. DENV C protein aids in inhibition of apoptosis in Huh7 cells by interacting with calcium-modulating cyclophilin-binding ligand, an ER protein associated with cell survival by regulating Bim-dependent death. DENV C also interacts with cellular protein DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) Box Helicase 3, X-linked, resulting in higher viral titers and down-regulation of innate immune responses against DENV independent of the type I IFN pathway.",

The NS proteins are responsible for viral replication and host innate immune evasion. The innate immune response to DENV is not well characterized nor are the exact roles of the NS proteins in evading the immune response. The main innate immune response is type I IFN and the main evasion mechanism of the virus is to target against the type I IFN response. Other innate immune responses include complement activation, apoptosis, autophagy, and RNAi. It is important to understand the host innate immune response to infection and how the virus evades or exploits this in order to develop effective antivirals and vaccines.",
