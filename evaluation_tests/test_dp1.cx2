This apoptosis in the absence of NF-kappaB depends on the persistent activation of the JNK axis followed by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Chen et al.,). Interestingly, previous experiments demonstrated that TNF activated NF-kappaB and JNK signaling with different dynamics (Iqbal and Zaidi,), suggesting the existence of intra-cellular decision making processes discriminating between cyto-protection via NF-kappaB and programmed cell death via JNK. However, the functional duality of this system is a matter of debate and precise mechanisms regulating hepatocellular cell fate are not well understood.",
